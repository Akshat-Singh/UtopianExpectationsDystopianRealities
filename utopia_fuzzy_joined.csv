1164,"More, Thomas, Saint",Utopia,And supposing that only one religion was really true and the rest false he imagined that the native force of truth would at last break forth and shine bright if supported only by the strength of argument and attended to with a gentle and unprejudiced mind while on the other hand if such debates were carried on with violence and tumults as the most wicked are always the most obstinate so the best and most holy religion might be choked with superstition as corn is with briars and thorns he therefore left men wholly to their liberty that they might be free to believe as they should see cause only he made a solemn and severe law against such as should so far degenerate from the dignity of human nature as to think that our souls died with our bodies or that the world was governed by chance without a wise overruling Providence for they all formerly believed that there was a state of rewards and punishments to the good and bad after this life and they now look on those that think otherwise as scarce fit to be counted men since they degrade so noble a being as the soul and reckon it no better than a beasts thus they are far from looking on such men as fit for human society or to be citizens of a wellordered commonwealth since a man of such principles must needs as oft as he dares do it despise all their laws and customs for there is no doubt to be made that a man who is afraid of nothing but the law and apprehends nothing after death will not scruple to break through all the laws of his country either by fraud or force when by this means he may satisfy his appetites,4387,Providence,location
1165,"More, Thomas, Saint",Utopia,Yet they do not punish them because they lay this down as a maxim that a man cannot make himself believe anything he pleases nor do they drive any to dissemble their thoughts by threatenings so that men are not tempted to lie or disguise their opinions which being a sort of fraud is abhorred by the Utopians they take care indeed to prevent their disputing in defence of these opinions especially before the common people but they suffer and even encourage them to dispute concerning them in private with their priest and other grave men being confident that they will be cured of those mad opinions by having reason laid before them,4389,Utopia,location
1166,"More, Thomas, Saint",Utopia,Another sort of them is less willing to put themselves to much toil and therefore prefer a married state to a single one and as they do not deny themselves the pleasure of it so they think the begetting of children is a debt which they owe to human nature and to their country nor do they avoid any pleasure that does not hinder labour and therefore eat flesh so much the more willingly as they find that by this means they are the more able to work the Utopians look upon these as the wiser sect but they esteem the others as the most holy,4405,Utopia,location
1167,"More, Thomas, Saint",Utopia,It is a reproach to a man to be sent for by any of them or for them to speak to him in secret for that always gives some suspicion all that is incumbent on them is only to exhort and admonish the people for the power of correcting and punishing ill men belongs wholly to the Prince and to the other magistrates the severest thing that the priest does is the excluding those that are desperately wicked from joining in their worship there is not any sort of punishment more dreaded by them than this for as it loads them with infamy so it fills them with secret horrors such is their reverence to their religion nor will their bodies be long exempted from their share of trouble for if they do not very quickly satisfy the priests of the truth of their repentance they are seized on by the Senate and punished for their impiety,4413,Prince,person
1168,"More, Thomas, Saint",Utopia,When the Utopians engage in battle the priests who accompany them to the war apparelled in their sacred vestments kneel down during the action in a place not far from the field and lifting up their hands to heaven pray first for peace and then for victory to their own side and particularly that it may be gained without the effusion of much blood on either side and when the victory turns to their side they run in among their own men to restrain their fury and if any of their enemies see them or call to them they are preserved by that means and such as can come so near them as to touch their garments have not only their lives but their fortunes secured to them it is upon this account that all the nations round about consider them so much and treat them with such reverence that they have been often no less able to preserve their own people from the fury of their enemies than to save their enemies from their rage for it has sometimes fallen out that when their armies have been in disorder and forced to fly so that their enemies were running upon the slaughter and spoil the priests by interposing have separated them from one another and stopped the effusion of more blood so that by their mediation a peace has been concluded on very reasonable terms nor is,4419,Utopia,location
1169,"More, Thomas, Saint",Utopia,In these they acknowledge God to be the author and governor of the world and the fountain of all the good they receive and therefore offer up to him their thanksgiving and in particular bless him for His goodness in ordering it so that they are born under the happiest government in the world and are of a religion which they hope is the truest of all others but if they are mistaken and if there is either a better government or a religion more acceptable to God they implore His goodness to let them know it vowing that they resolve to follow him whithersoever he leads them but if their government is the best and their religion the truest then they pray that He may fortify them in it and bring all the world both to the same rules of life and to the same opinions concerning Himself unless according to the unsearchableness of His mind He is pleased with a variety of religions,4441,Himself,person
1170,"More, Thomas, Saint",Utopia,Then they pray that God may give them an easy passage at last to Himself not presuming to set limits to Him how early or late it should be but if it may be wished for without derogating from His supreme authority they desire to be quickly delivered and to be taken to Himself though by the most terrible kind of death rather than to be detained long from seeing Him by the most prosperous course of life,4442,Himself,person
1171,"More, Thomas, Saint",Utopia,In all other places it is visible that while people talk of a commonwealth every man only seeks his own wealth but there where no man has any property all men zealously pursue the good of the public and indeed it is no wonder to see men act so differently for in other commonwealths every man knows that unless he provides for himself how flourishing soever the commonwealth may be he must die of hunger so that he sees the necessity of preferring his own concerns to the public but in Utopia where every man has a right to everything they all know that if care is taken to keep the public stores full no private man can want anything for among them there is no unequal distribution so that no man is poor none in necessity and though no man has anything yet they are all rich for what can make a man so rich as to lead a serene and cheerful life free from anxieties neither apprehending want himself nor vexed with the endless complaints of his wife,4445,Utopia,location
1172,"More, Thomas, Saint",Utopia,Therefore I must say that as I hope for mercy I can have no other notion of all the other governments that I see or know than that they are a conspiracy of the rich who on pretence of managing the public only pursue their private ends and devise all the ways and arts they can find out first that they may without danger preserve all that they have so illacquired and then that they may engage the poor to toil and labour for them at as low rates as possible and oppress them as much as they please and if they can but prevail to get these contrivances established by the show of public authority which is considered as the representative of the whole people then they are accounted laws yet these wicked men after they have by a most insatiable covetousness divided that among themselves with which all the rest might have been well supplied are far from that happiness that is enjoyed among the Utopians for the use as well as the desire of money being extinguished much anxiety and great occasions of mischief is cut off with it and who does not see that the frauds thefts robberies quarrels tumults contentions seditions murders treacheries and witchcrafts which are indeed rather punished than restrained by the severities of law would all fall off if money were not any more valued by the world,4453,Utopia,location
1173,"More, Thomas, Saint",Utopia,I do not doubt but rich men are sensible of this and that they well know how much a greater happiness it is to want nothing necessary than to abound in many superfluities and to be rescued out of so much misery than to abound with so much wealth and I cannot think but the sense of every mans interest added to the authority of Christs commands who as He was infinitely wise knew what was best and was not less good in discovering it to us would have drawn all the world over to the laws of the Utopians if pride that plague of human nature that source of so much misery did not hinder it for this vice does not measure happiness so much by its own conveniences as by the miseries of others and would not be satisfied with being thought a goddess if none were left that were miserable over whom she might insult,4456,Utopia,location
1174,"More, Thomas, Saint",Utopia,This is that infernal serpent that creeps into the breasts of mortals and possesses them too much to be easily drawn out and therefore I am glad that the Utopians have fallen upon this form of government in which I wish that all the world could be so wise as to imitate them for they have indeed laid down such a scheme and foundation of policy that as men live happily under it so it is like to be of great continuance for they having rooted out of the minds of their people all the seeds both of ambition and faction there is no danger of any commotions at home which alone has been the ruin of many states that seemed otherwise to be well secured but as long as they live in peace at home and are governed by such good laws the envy of all their neighbouring princes who have often though in vain attempted their ruin will never be able to put their state into any commotion or disorder,4458,Utopia,location
1175,"More, Thomas, Saint",Utopia,When Raphael had thus made an end of speaking though many things occurred to me both concerning the manners and laws of that people that seemed very absurd as well in their way of making war as in their notions of religion and divine matterstogether with several other particulars but chiefly what seemed the foundation of all the rest their living in common without the use of money by which all nobility magnificence splendour and majesty which according to the common opinion are the true ornaments of a nation would be quite taken awayyet since I perceived that Raphael was weary and was not sure whether he could easily bear contradiction remembering that he had taken notice of some who seemed to think they were bound in honour to support the credit of their own wisdom by finding out something to censure in all other mens inventions besides their own I only commended their Constitution and the account he had given of it in general and so taking him by the hand carried him to supper and told him I would find out some other time for examining this subject more particularly and for discoursing more copiously upon it,4459,Raphael,person
