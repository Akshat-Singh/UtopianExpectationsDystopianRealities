2,"With a clamor of bells that set the swallows soaring, the Festival of Summer came to the city",The Ones Who Walk Away From Omelas,Ursula K. Le Guin
3,"Omelas, bright-towered by the sea. The rigging of the boats in harbor sparkled with flags. In the",The Ones Who Walk Away From Omelas,Ursula K. Le Guin
4,"streets between houses with red roofs and painted walls, between old moss-grown gardens and",The Ones Who Walk Away From Omelas,Ursula K. Le Guin
5,"under avenues of trees, past great parks and public buildings, processions moved. Some were",The Ones Who Walk Away From Omelas,Ursula K. Le Guin
6,"decorous: old people in long stiff robes of mauve and grey, grave master workmen, quiet, merry",The Ones Who Walk Away From Omelas,Ursula K. Le Guin

8,"a shimmering of gong and tambourine, and the people went dancing, the procession was a",The Ones Who Walk Away From Omelas,Ursula K. Le Guin
9,"dance. Children dodged in and out, their high calls rising like the swallows crossing flights over",The Ones Who Walk Away From Omelas,Ursula K. Le Guin
10,"the music and the singing. All the processions wound towards the north side of the city, where",The Ones Who Walk Away From Omelas,Ursula K. Le Guin
11,"on the great water-meadow called the Green Fields boys and girls, naked in the bright air, with",The Ones Who Walk Away From Omelas,Ursula K. Le Guin
12,"mud-stained feet and ankles and long, lithe arms, exercised their restive horses before the race.",The Ones Who Walk Away From Omelas,Ursula K. Le Guin
13,The horses wore no gear at all but a halter without bit. Their manes were braided with streamers,The Ones Who Walk Away From Omelas,Ursula K. Le Guin
14,"of silver, gold, and green. They flared their nostrils and pranced and boasted to one another;",The Ones Who Walk Away From Omelas,Ursula K. Le Guin
15,"they were vastly excited, the horse being the only animal who has adopted our ceremonies as",The Ones Who Walk Away From Omelas,Ursula K. Le Guin
16,his own. Far off to the north and west the mountains stood up half encircling Omelas on her bay.,The Ones Who Walk Away From Omelas,Ursula K. Le Guin
17,The air of morning was so clear that the snow still crowning the Eighteen Peaks burned with,The Ones Who Walk Away From Omelas,Ursula K. Le Guin
18,"white-gold fire across the miles of sunlit air, under the dark blue of the sky. There was just",The Ones Who Walk Away From Omelas,Ursula K. Le Guin
19,enough wind to make the banners that marked the racecourse snap and flutter now and then. In,The Ones Who Walk Away From Omelas,Ursula K. Le Guin
20,the silence of the broad green meadows one could hear the music winding through the city,The Ones Who Walk Away From Omelas,Ursula K. Le Guin
21,"streets, farther and nearer and ever approaching, a cheerful faint sweetness of the air that from",The Ones Who Walk Away From Omelas,Ursula K. Le Guin
22,time to time trembled and gathered together and broke out into the great joyous clanging of the,The Ones Who Walk Away From Omelas,Ursula K. Le Guin
23,bells.,The Ones Who Walk Away From Omelas,Ursula K. Le Guin
24,Joyous! How is one to tell about joy? How describe the citizens of Omelas?,The Ones Who Walk Away From Omelas,Ursula K. Le Guin
25,"They were not simple folk, you see, though they were happy. But we do not say the words of",The Ones Who Walk Away From Omelas,Ursula K. Le Guin
26,cheer much any more. All smiles have become archaic. Given a description such as this one,The Ones Who Walk Away From Omelas,Ursula K. Le Guin
27,tends to make certain assumptions. Given a description such as this one tends to look next for,The Ones Who Walk Away From Omelas,Ursula K. Le Guin
28,"the King, mounted on a splendid stallion and surrounded by his noble knights, or perhaps in a",The Ones Who Walk Away From Omelas,Ursula K. Le Guin
29,"golden litter borne by great-muscled slaves. But there was no king. They did not use swords, or",The Ones Who Walk Away From Omelas,Ursula K. Le Guin
30,"keep slaves. They were not barbarians. I do not know the rules and laws of their society, but I",The Ones Who Walk Away From Omelas,Ursula K. Le Guin
31,"suspect that they were singularly few. As they did without monarchy and slavery, so they also",The Ones Who Walk Away From Omelas,Ursula K. Le Guin
32,"got on without the stock exchange, the advertisement, the secret police, and the bomb. Yet I",The Ones Who Walk Away From Omelas,Ursula K. Le Guin
33,"repeat that these were not simple folk, not dulcet shepherds, noble savages, bland utopians.",The Ones Who Walk Away From Omelas,Ursula K. Le Guin
34,"They were not less complex than us. The trouble is that we have a bad habit, encouraged by",The Ones Who Walk Away From Omelas,Ursula K. Le Guin
35,"pedants and sophisticates, of considering happiness as something rather stupid. Only pain is",The Ones Who Walk Away From Omelas,Ursula K. Le Guin
36,"intellectual, only evil interesting. This is the treason of the artist: a refusal to admit the banality of",The Ones Who Walk Away From Omelas,Ursula K. Le Guin
37,"evil and the terrible boredom of pain. If you cant lick òem, join òem. If it hurts, repeat it. But to",The Ones Who Walk Away From Omelas,Ursula K. Le Guin
38,"praise despair is to condemn delight, to embrace violence is to lose hold of everything else. We",The Ones Who Walk Away From Omelas,Ursula K. Le Guin
39,"have almost lost hold; we can no longer describe a happy man, nor make any celebration of joy.",The Ones Who Walk Away From Omelas,Ursula K. Le Guin
40,How can I tell you about the people of Omelas? They were not naive and happy childrenî,The Ones Who Walk Away From Omelas,Ursula K. Le Guin
41,"though their children were, in fact, happy. They were mature, intelligent, passionate adults",The Ones Who Walk Away From Omelas,Ursula K. Le Guin
42,whose lives were not wretched. O miracle! but I wish I could describe it better. I wish I could,The Ones Who Walk Away From Omelas,Ursula K. Le Guin
43,"convince you. Omelas sounds in my words like a city in a fairy tale, long ago and far away, once",The Ones Who Walk Away From Omelas,Ursula K. Le Guin
44,"upon a time. Perhaps it would be best if you imagined it as your own fancy bids, assuming it will",The Ones Who Walk Away From Omelas,Ursula K. Le Guin
45,"rise to the occasion, for certainly I cannot suit you all. For instance, how about technology? I",The Ones Who Walk Away From Omelas,Ursula K. Le Guin
46,think that there would be no cars or helicopters in and above the streets; this follows from the,The Ones Who Walk Away From Omelas,Ursula K. Le Guin
47,fact that the people of Omelas are happy people. Happiness is based on a just discrimination of,The Ones Who Walk Away From Omelas,Ursula K. Le Guin
48,"what is necessary, what is neither necessary nor destructive, and what is destructive. In the",The Ones Who Walk Away From Omelas,Ursula K. Le Guin
49,"middle category, howeverîthat of the unnecessary but undestructive, that of comfort, luxury,",The Ones Who Walk Away From Omelas,Ursula K. Le Guin
50,"exuberance, etc.îthey could perfectly well have central heating, subway trains, washing",The Ones Who Walk Away From Omelas,Ursula K. Le Guin
51,"machines, and all kinds of marvelous devices not yet invented here, floating light-sources,",The Ones Who Walk Away From Omelas,Ursula K. Le Guin
52,"fuelless power, a cure for the common cold. Or they could have none of that; it doesnt matter.",The Ones Who Walk Away From Omelas,Ursula K. Le Guin
53,As you like it. I incline to think that people from towns up and down the coast have been coming,The Ones Who Walk Away From Omelas,Ursula K. Le Guin
54,in to Omelas during the last days before the Festival on very fast little trains and double-decked,The Ones Who Walk Away From Omelas,Ursula K. Le Guin
55,"trams, and that the train station of Omelas is actually the handsomest building in town, though",The Ones Who Walk Away From Omelas,Ursula K. Le Guin
56,"plainer than the magnificent Farmers Market. But even granted trains, I fear that Omelas so far",The Ones Who Walk Away From Omelas,Ursula K. Le Guin
57,"strikes some of you as goody-goody. Smiles, bells, parades, horses, bleh. If so, please add an",The Ones Who Walk Away From Omelas,Ursula K. Le Guin
58,"orgy. If an orgy would help, dont hesitate. Let us not, however, have temples from which issue",The Ones Who Walk Away From Omelas,Ursula K. Le Guin
59,beautiful nude priests and priestesses already half in ecstasy and ready to copulate with any,The Ones Who Walk Away From Omelas,Ursula K. Le Guin
60,"man or woman, lover or stranger, who desires union with the deep godhead of the blood,",The Ones Who Walk Away From Omelas,Ursula K. Le Guin
61,although that was my first idea. But really it would be better not to have any temples in,The Ones Who Walk Away From Omelas,Ursula K. Le Guin
62,"Omelasîat least, not manned temples. Religion yes, clergy no. Surely the beautiful nudes can",The Ones Who Walk Away From Omelas,Ursula K. Le Guin
63,"just wander about, offering themselves like divine souffles to the hunger of the needy and the",The Ones Who Walk Away From Omelas,Ursula K. Le Guin
64,rapture of the flesh. Let them join the processions. Let tambourines be struck above the,The Ones Who Walk Away From Omelas,Ursula K. Le Guin
65,"copulations, and the glory of desire be proclaimed upon the gongs, and (a not unimportant",The Ones Who Walk Away From Omelas,Ursula K. Le Guin
66,point) let the offspring of these delightful rituals be beloved and looked after by all. One thing I,The Ones Who Walk Away From Omelas,Ursula K. Le Guin
67,know there is none of in Omelas is guilt. But what else should there be? I thought at first there,The Ones Who Walk Away From Omelas,Ursula K. Le Guin
68,"were not drugs, but that is puritanical. For those who like it, the faint insistent sweetness of",The Ones Who Walk Away From Omelas,Ursula K. Le Guin
69,"drooz may perfume the ways of the city, drooz which first brings a great lightness and brilliance",The Ones Who Walk Away From Omelas,Ursula K. Le Guin
70,"to the mind and limbs, and then after some hours a dreamy languor, and wonderful visions at",The Ones Who Walk Away From Omelas,Ursula K. Le Guin
71,"last of the very arcana and inmost secrets of the Universe, as well as exciting the pleasure of",The Ones Who Walk Away From Omelas,Ursula K. Le Guin
72,sex beyond belief; and it is not habit-forming. For more modest tastes I think there ought to be,The Ones Who Walk Away From Omelas,Ursula K. Le Guin
73,"beer. What else, what else belongs in the joyous city? The sense of victory, surely, the",The Ones Who Walk Away From Omelas,Ursula K. Le Guin
74,"celebration of courage. But as we did without clergy, let us do without soldiers. The joy built",The Ones Who Walk Away From Omelas,Ursula K. Le Guin
75,upon successful slaughter is not the right kind of joy; it will not do; it is fearful and it is trivial. A,The Ones Who Walk Away From Omelas,Ursula K. Le Guin
76,"boundless and generous contentment, a magnanimous triumph felt not against some outer",The Ones Who Walk Away From Omelas,Ursula K. Le Guin
77,enemy but in communion with the finest and fairest in the souls of all men everywhere and the,The Ones Who Walk Away From Omelas,Ursula K. Le Guin
78,"splendor of the worlds summer: this is what swells the hearts of the people of Omelas, and the",The Ones Who Walk Away From Omelas,Ursula K. Le Guin
79,victory they celebrate is that of life. I really dont think many of them need to take drooz.,The Ones Who Walk Away From Omelas,Ursula K. Le Guin
80,Most of the procession have reached the Green Fields by now. A marvelous smell of cooking,The Ones Who Walk Away From Omelas,Ursula K. Le Guin
81,goes forth from the red and blue tents of the provisioners. The faces of small children are,The Ones Who Walk Away From Omelas,Ursula K. Le Guin
82,amiably sticky; in the benign grey beard of a man a couple of crumbs of rich pastry are,The Ones Who Walk Away From Omelas,Ursula K. Le Guin
83,entangled. The youths and girls have mounted their horses and are beginning to group around,The Ones Who Walk Away From Omelas,Ursula K. Le Guin
84,"the starting line of the course. An old women, small, fat, and laughing, is passing out flowers",The Ones Who Walk Away From Omelas,Ursula K. Le Guin
85,"from a basket, and tall young men wear her flowers in their shining hair. A child of nine or ten",The Ones Who Walk Away From Omelas,Ursula K. Le Guin
86,"sits at the edge of the crowd, alone, playing on a wooden flute. People pause to listen, and they",The Ones Who Walk Away From Omelas,Ursula K. Le Guin
87,"smile, but they do not speak to him, for he never ceases playing and never sees them, his dark",The Ones Who Walk Away From Omelas,Ursula K. Le Guin
88,"eyes wholly rapt in the sweet, thin magic of the tune.",The Ones Who Walk Away From Omelas,Ursula K. Le Guin
89,"He finishes, and slowly lowers his hands holding the wooden flute.",The Ones Who Walk Away From Omelas,Ursula K. Le Guin
90,"As if that little private silence were the signal, all at once a trumpet sounds from the pavilion",The Ones Who Walk Away From Omelas,Ursula K. Le Guin
91,"near the starting line: imperious, melancholy, piercing. The horses rear on their slender legs,",The Ones Who Walk Away From Omelas,Ursula K. Le Guin
92,"and some of them neigh in answer. Sober-faced, the young riders stroke the horses necks and",The Ones Who Walk Away From Omelas,Ursula K. Le Guin
93,"soothe them, whispering, úQuiet, quiet, there my beauty, my hope....ù They begin to form in rank",The Ones Who Walk Away From Omelas,Ursula K. Le Guin
94,along the starting line. The crowds along the racecourse are like a field of grass and flowers in,The Ones Who Walk Away From Omelas,Ursula K. Le Guin
95,the wind. The Festival of Summer has begun.,The Ones Who Walk Away From Omelas,Ursula K. Le Guin
96,"Do you believe? Do you accept the festival, the city, the joy? No? Then let me describe one",The Ones Who Walk Away From Omelas,Ursula K. Le Guin
97,more thing.,The Ones Who Walk Away From Omelas,Ursula K. Le Guin
98,"In a basement under one of the beautiful public buildings of Omelas, or perhaps in the cellar of",The Ones Who Walk Away From Omelas,Ursula K. Le Guin
99,"one of its spacious private homes, there is a room. It has one locked door, and no window. A",The Ones Who Walk Away From Omelas,Ursula K. Le Guin
100,"little light seeps in dustily between cracks in the boards, secondhand from a cobwebbed window",The Ones Who Walk Away From Omelas,Ursula K. Le Guin
101,"somewhere across the cellar. In one corner of the little room a couple of mops, with stiff, clotted,",The Ones Who Walk Away From Omelas,Ursula K. Le Guin
102,"foul-smelling heads stand near a rusty bucket. The floor is dirt, a little damp to the touch, as",The Ones Who Walk Away From Omelas,Ursula K. Le Guin
103,cellar dirt usually is. The room is about three paces long and two wide: a mere broom closet or,The Ones Who Walk Away From Omelas,Ursula K. Le Guin
104,"disused tool room. In the room a child is sitting. It could be a boy or a girl. It looks about six, but",The Ones Who Walk Away From Omelas,Ursula K. Le Guin
105,"actually is nearly ten. It is feeble-minded. Perhaps it was born defective, or perhaps it has",The Ones Who Walk Away From Omelas,Ursula K. Le Guin
106,"become imbecile through fear, malnutrition, and neglect. It picks its nose and occasionally",The Ones Who Walk Away From Omelas,Ursula K. Le Guin
107,"fumbles vaguely with its toes or genitals, as it sits hunched in the corner farthest from the bucket",The Ones Who Walk Away From Omelas,Ursula K. Le Guin
108,"and the two mops. It is afraid of the mops. It finds them horrible. It shuts its eyes, but it knows",The Ones Who Walk Away From Omelas,Ursula K. Le Guin
109,the mops are still standing there; and the door is locked; and nobody will come. The door is,The Ones Who Walk Away From Omelas,Ursula K. Le Guin
110,"always locked; and nobody ever comes, except that sometimesîthe child has no",The Ones Who Walk Away From Omelas,Ursula K. Le Guin
111,"understanding of time or intervalîsometimes the door rattles terribly and opens, and a person,",The Ones Who Walk Away From Omelas,Ursula K. Le Guin
112,"or several people, are there. One of them may come in and kick the child to make it stand up.",The Ones Who Walk Away From Omelas,Ursula K. Le Guin
113,"The others never come close, but peer in at it with frightened, disgusted eyes. The food bowl",The Ones Who Walk Away From Omelas,Ursula K. Le Guin
114,"and the water jug are hastily filled, the door is locked, the eyes disappear. The people at the",The Ones Who Walk Away From Omelas,Ursula K. Le Guin
115,"door never say anything, but the child, who has not always lived in the tool room, and can",The Ones Who Walk Away From Omelas,Ursula K. Le Guin
116,"remember sunlight and its mothers voice, sometimes speaks. úI will be good,ù it says. úPlease",The Ones Who Walk Away From Omelas,Ursula K. Le Guin
117,"let me out. I will be good!ù They never answer. The child used to scream for help at night, and",The Ones Who Walk Away From Omelas,Ursula K. Le Guin
118,"cry a good deal, but now it only makes a kind of whining, úeh-haa, eh-haa,ù and it speaks less",The Ones Who Walk Away From Omelas,Ursula K. Le Guin
119,and less often. It is so thin there are no calves to its legs; its belly protrudes; ,The Ones Who Walk Away From Omelas,Ursula K. Le Guin
120,it lives on a halfbowl of corn meal and grease a day. It is naked. ,The Ones Who Walk Away From Omelas,Ursula K. Le Guin
121,"Its buttocks and thighs are a mass of festered sores, as it sits in its own excrement continually.",The Ones Who Walk Away From Omelas,Ursula K. Le Guin
122,"They all know it is there, all the people of Omelas. Some of them have come to see it, others",The Ones Who Walk Away From Omelas,Ursula K. Le Guin
123,are content merely to know it is there. They all know that it has to be there. Some of them,The Ones Who Walk Away From Omelas,Ursula K. Le Guin
124,"understand why, and some do not, but they all understand that their happiness, the beauty of",The Ones Who Walk Away From Omelas,Ursula K. Le Guin
125,"their city, the tenderness of their friendships, the health of their children, the wisdom of their",The Ones Who Walk Away From Omelas,Ursula K. Le Guin
126,"scholars, the skill of their makers, even the abundance of their harvest and the kindly weathers",The Ones Who Walk Away From Omelas,Ursula K. Le Guin
127,"of their skies, depend wholly on this childs abominable misery.",The Ones Who Walk Away From Omelas,Ursula K. Le Guin
128,"This is usually explained to children when they are between eight and twelve, whenever they",The Ones Who Walk Away From Omelas,Ursula K. Le Guin
129,seem capable of understanding; and most of those who come to see the child are young,The Ones Who Walk Away From Omelas,Ursula K. Le Guin
130,"people, though often enough an adult comes, or comes back, to see the child. No matter how",The Ones Who Walk Away From Omelas,Ursula K. Le Guin
131,"well the matter has been explained to them, these young spectators are always shocked and",The Ones Who Walk Away From Omelas,Ursula K. Le Guin
132,"sickened at the sight. They feel disgust, which they had thought themselves superior to. They",The Ones Who Walk Away From Omelas,Ursula K. Le Guin
133,"feel anger, outrage, impotence, despite all the explanations. They would like to do something for",The Ones Who Walk Away From Omelas,Ursula K. Le Guin
134,the child. But there is nothing they can do. If the child were brought up into the sunlight out of,The Ones Who Walk Away From Omelas,Ursula K. Le Guin
135,"that vile place, if it were cleaned and fed and comforted, that would be a good thing indeed; but",The Ones Who Walk Away From Omelas,Ursula K. Le Guin
136,"if it were done, in that day and hour all the prosperity and beauty and delight of Omelas would",The Ones Who Walk Away From Omelas,Ursula K. Le Guin
137,wither and be destroyed. Those are the terms. To exchange all the goodness and grace of,The Ones Who Walk Away From Omelas,Ursula K. Le Guin
138,"every life in Omelas for that single, small improvement: to throw away the happiness of",The Ones Who Walk Away From Omelas,Ursula K. Le Guin
139,thousands for the chance of the happiness of one: that would be to let guilt within the walls,The Ones Who Walk Away From Omelas,Ursula K. Le Guin
140,indeed.,The Ones Who Walk Away From Omelas,Ursula K. Le Guin
141,The terms are strict and absolute; there may not even be a kind word spoken to the child.,The Ones Who Walk Away From Omelas,Ursula K. Le Guin
142,"Often the young people go home in tears, or in a tearless rage, when they have seen the child",The Ones Who Walk Away From Omelas,Ursula K. Le Guin
143,and faced this terrible paradox. They may brood over it for weeks or years. But as time goes on,The Ones Who Walk Away From Omelas,Ursula K. Le Guin
144,"they begin to realize that even if the child could be released, it would not get much good of its",The Ones Who Walk Away From Omelas,Ursula K. Le Guin
145,"freedom: a little vague pleasure of warmth and food, no doubt, but little more. It is too degraded",The Ones Who Walk Away From Omelas,Ursula K. Le Guin
146,and imbecile to know any real joy. It has been afraid too long ever to be free of fear. Its habits,The Ones Who Walk Away From Omelas,Ursula K. Le Guin
147,"are too uncouth for it to respond to humane treatment. Indeed, after so long it would probably be",The Ones Who Walk Away From Omelas,Ursula K. Le Guin
148,"wretched without walls about it to protect it, and darkness for its eyes, and its own excrement to",The Ones Who Walk Away From Omelas,Ursula K. Le Guin
149,sit in. Their tears at the bitter injustice dry when they begin to perceive the terrible justice of,The Ones Who Walk Away From Omelas,Ursula K. Le Guin
150,"reality, and to accept it. Yet it is their tears and anger, the trying of their generosity and the",The Ones Who Walk Away From Omelas,Ursula K. Le Guin
151,"acceptance of their helplessness, which are perhaps the true source of the splendor of their",The Ones Who Walk Away From Omelas,Ursula K. Le Guin
152,"lives. Theirs is no vapid, irresponsible happiness. They know that they, like the child, are not",The Ones Who Walk Away From Omelas,Ursula K. Le Guin
153,"free. They know compassion. It is the existence of the child, and their knowledge of its",The Ones Who Walk Away From Omelas,Ursula K. Le Guin
154,"existence, that makes possible the nobility of their architecture, the poignancy of their music, the",The Ones Who Walk Away From Omelas,Ursula K. Le Guin
155,profundity of their science. It is because of the child that they are so gentle with children. They,The Ones Who Walk Away From Omelas,Ursula K. Le Guin
156,"know that if the wretched one were not there sniveling in the dark, the other one, the fluteplayer, ",The Ones Who Walk Away From Omelas,Ursula K. Le Guin

160,and this is quite incredible.,The Ones Who Walk Away From Omelas,Ursula K. Le Guin
161,At times one of the adolescent girls or boys who go to see the child does not go home to weep,The Ones Who Walk Away From Omelas,Ursula K. Le Guin
162,"or rage, does not, in fact, go home at all. Sometimes also a man or woman much older falls",The Ones Who Walk Away From Omelas,Ursula K. Le Guin

One evening I was lounging in an easy chair in my bedroom and thinking lazily of
the condition of Indian womanhood. I am not sure whether I dozed off or not. But,
as far as I remember, I was wide awake. I saw the moonlit sky sparkling with
thousands of diamond-like stars, very distinctly.
All on a sudden a lady stood before me; how she came in, I do not know. I took
her for my friend, Sister Sara.
Good morning, said Sister Sara. I smiled inwardly as I knew it was not morning,
but starry night. However, I replied to her, saying, How do you do?
I am all right, thank you. Will you please come out and have a look at our",Sultanaís Dream,Rokheya Shekhawat Hossein
3593,"garden?
I looked again at the moon through the open window, and thought there was no
harm in going out at that time. The men-servants outside were fast asleep just then,
and I could have a pleasant walk with Sister Sara.
I used to have my walks with Sister Sara, when we were at Darjeeling. Many a
time did we walk hand in hand and talk light-heartedly in the botanical gardens
there. I fancied, Sister Sara had probably come to take me to some such garden
and I readily accepted her offer and went out with her.
When walking I found to my surprise that it was a fine morning. The town was
fully awake and the streets alive with bustling crowds. I was feeling very shy,
thinking I was walking in the street in broad daylight, but there was not a single
man visible.
Some of the passers-by made jokes at me. Though I could not understand their
language, yet I felt sure they were joking. I asked my friend, What do they say?
The women say that you look very mannish.
Mannish? said I, What do they mean by that?
They mean that you are shy and timid like men.

Shy and timid like men? It was really a joke. I became very nervous, when I
found that my companion was not Sister Sara, but a stranger. Oh, what a fool had I
been to mistake this lady for my dear old friend, Sister Sara.
She felt my fingers tremble in her hand, as we were walking hand in hand.
What is the matter, dear? she said affectionately. I feel somewhat awkward, I
said in a rather apologizing tone, as being a purdahnishin woman I am not",Sultanaís Dream,Rokheya Shekhawat Hossein
3594,"accustomed to walking about unveiled.
You need not be afraid of coming across a man here. This is Ladyland, free from",Sultanaís Dream,Rokheya Shekhawat Hossein
3595,"sin and harm. Virtue herself reigns here.
By and by I was enjoying the scenery. Really it was very grand. I mistook a patch
of green grass for a velvet cushion. Feeling as if I were walking on a soft carpet, I
looked down and found the path covered with moss and flowers.
How nice it is, said I.
Do you like it? asked Sister Sara. (I continued calling her Sister Sara, and she
kept calling me by my name).
Yes, very much; but I do not like to tread on the tender and sweet flowers.
Never mind, dear Sultana; your treading will not harm them; they are street",Sultanaís Dream,Rokheya Shekhawat Hossein
3596,"flowers.
The whole place looks like a garden, said I admiringly. You have arranged every",Sultanaís Dream,Rokheya Shekhawat Hossein
3597,"plant so skillfully.
Your Calcutta could become a nicer garden than this if only your countrymen",Sultanaís Dream,Rokheya Shekhawat Hossein
3598,"wanted to make it so.
They would think it useless to give so much attention to horticulture, while they",Sultanaís Dream,Rokheya Shekhawat Hossein
3599,"have so many other things to do.
They could not find a better excuse, said she with smile.
I became very curious to know where the men were. I met more than a hundred
women while walking there, but not a single man.
Where are the men? I asked her.
In their proper places, where they ought to be.

Pray let me know what you mean by their proper places.
O, I see my mistake, you cannot know our customs, as you were never here",Sultanaís Dream,Rokheya Shekhawat Hossein
3600,"before. We shut our men indoors.
Just as we are kept in the zenana?
Exactly so.
How funny, I burst into a laugh. Sister Sara laughed too.
But dear Sultana, how unfair it is to shut in the harmless women and let loose the",Sultanaís Dream,Rokheya Shekhawat Hossein
3601,"men.
Why? It is not safe for us to come out of the zenana, as we are naturally weak.
Yes, it is not safe so long as there are men about the streets, nor is it so when a",Sultanaís Dream,Rokheya Shekhawat Hossein
3602,"wild animal enters a marketplace.
Of course not.
Suppose, some lunatics escape from the asylum and begin to do all sorts of",Sultanaís Dream,Rokheya Shekhawat Hossein
3603,"mischief to men, horses and other creatures; in that case what will your",Sultanaís Dream,Rokheya Shekhawat Hossein
3604,"countrymen do?
They will try to capture them and put them back into their asylum.
Thank you! And you do not think it wise to keep sane people inside an asylum",Sultanaís Dream,Rokheya Shekhawat Hossein
3605,"and let loose the insane?
Of course not! said I laughing lightly.
As a matter of fact, in your country this very thing is done! Men, who do or at",Sultanaís Dream,Rokheya Shekhawat Hossein
3606,"least are capable of doing no end of mischief, are let loose and the innocent",Sultanaís Dream,Rokheya Shekhawat Hossein
3607,"women, shut up in the zenana! How can you trust those untrained men out of",Sultanaís Dream,Rokheya Shekhawat Hossein
3608,"doors?
We have no hand or voice in the management of our social affairs. In India man is",Sultanaís Dream,Rokheya Shekhawat Hossein
3609,"lord and master, he has taken to himself all powers and privileges and shut up the",Sultanaís Dream,Rokheya Shekhawat Hossein
3610,"women in the zenana.
Why do you allow yourselves to be shut up?
Because it cannot be helped as they are stronger than women.



Sultanas Dream

A lion is stronger than a man, but it does not enable him to dominate the human",Sultanaís Dream,Rokheya Shekhawat Hossein
3611,race. You have neglected the duty you owe to yourselves and you have lost your,Sultanaís Dream,Rokheya Shekhawat Hossein
3612,"natural rights by shutting your eyes to your own interests.
But my dear Sister Sara, if we do everything by ourselves, what will the men do",Sultanaís Dream,Rokheya Shekhawat Hossein
3613,"then?
They should not do anything, excuse me; they are fit for nothing. Only catch them",Sultanaís Dream,Rokheya Shekhawat Hossein
3614,"and put them into the zenana.
But would it be very easy to catch and put them inside the four walls? said I. And",Sultanaís Dream,Rokheya Shekhawat Hossein
3615,"even if this were done, would all their business ì political and commercial ì also",Sultanaís Dream,Rokheya Shekhawat Hossein
3616,"go with them into the zenana?
Sister Sara made no reply. She only smiled sweetly. Perhaps she thought it useless
to argue with one who was no better than a frog in a well.
By this time we reached Sister Saras house. It was situated in a beautiful heartshaped garden. It was a bungalow with a corrugated iron roof. It was cooler and",Sultanaís Dream,Rokheya Shekhawat Hossein
3617,nicer than any of our rich buildings. I cannot describe how neat and how nicely,Sultanaís Dream,Rokheya Shekhawat Hossein
3618,furnished and how tastefully decorated it was.,Sultanaís Dream,Rokheya Shekhawat Hossein
3619,We sat side by side. She brought out of the parlour a piece of embroidery work,Sultanaís Dream,Rokheya Shekhawat Hossein
3620,and began putting on a fresh design.,Sultanaís Dream,Rokheya Shekhawat Hossein
3621,Do you know knitting and needle work?,Sultanaís Dream,Rokheya Shekhawat Hossein
3622,Yes; we have nothing else to do in our zenana.,Sultanaís Dream,Rokheya Shekhawat Hossein
3623,"But we do not trust our zenana members with embroidery! she said laughing, as a
man has not patience enough to pass thread through a needlehole even!",Sultanaís Dream,Rokheya Shekhawat Hossein
3624,Have you done all this work yourself? I asked her pointing to the various pieces,Sultanaís Dream,Rokheya Shekhawat Hossein
3625,of embroidered teapoy cloths.,Sultanaís Dream,Rokheya Shekhawat Hossein
3626,Yes.,Sultanaís Dream,Rokheya Shekhawat Hossein
3627,"How can you find time to do all these? You have to do the office work as well?
Have you not?",Sultanaís Dream,Rokheya Shekhawat Hossein
3628,Yes. I do not stick to the laboratory all day long. I finish my work in two hours.,Sultanaís Dream,Rokheya Shekhawat Hossein

hours?",Sultanaís Dream,Rokheya Shekhawat Hossein
3633,Certainly they do!,Sultanaís Dream,Rokheya Shekhawat Hossein
3634," No, dear Sultana, they do not. They dawdle away their time in smoking. Some
smoke two or three choroots during the office time. They talk much about their
work, but do little. Suppose one choroot takes half an hour to burn off, and a man
smokes twelve choroots daily; then you see, he wastes six hours every day in sheer
smoking.",Sultanaís Dream,Rokheya Shekhawat Hossein
3635,"We talked on various subjects, and I learned that they were not subject to any kind",Sultanaís Dream,Rokheya Shekhawat Hossein
3636,"of epidemic disease, nor did they suffer from mosquito bites as we do. I was very",Sultanaís Dream,Rokheya Shekhawat Hossein

3638,accident.,Sultanaís Dream,Rokheya Shekhawat Hossein
3639,Will you care to see our kitchen? she asked me.,Sultanaís Dream,Rokheya Shekhawat Hossein
3640,"With pleasure, said I, and we went to see it. Of course the men had been asked to",Sultanaís Dream,Rokheya Shekhawat Hossein
3641,clear off when I was going there. The kitchen was situated in a beautiful vegetable,Sultanaís Dream,Rokheya Shekhawat Hossein
3642,"garden. Every creeper, every tomato plant was itself an ornament. I found no",Sultanaís Dream,Rokheya Shekhawat Hossein
3643,"smoke, nor any chimney either in the kitchen -- it was clean and bright; the",Sultanaís Dream,Rokheya Shekhawat Hossein
3644,windows were decorated with flower gardens. There was no sign of coal or fire.,Sultanaís Dream,Rokheya Shekhawat Hossein
3645,How do you cook? I asked.,Sultanaís Dream,Rokheya Shekhawat Hossein
3646,"With solar heat, she said, at the same time showing me the pipe, through which",Sultanaís Dream,Rokheya Shekhawat Hossein
3647,passed the concentrated sunlight and heat. And she cooked something then and,Sultanaís Dream,Rokheya Shekhawat Hossein
3648,there to show me the process.,Sultanaís Dream,Rokheya Shekhawat Hossein
3649,How did you manage to gather and store up the sun-heat? I asked her in,Sultanaís Dream,Rokheya Shekhawat Hossein
3650,amazement.,Sultanaís Dream,Rokheya Shekhawat Hossein
3651,"Let me tell you a little of our past history then. Thirty years ago, when our present
Queen was thirteen years old, she inherited the throne. She was Queen in name
only, the Prime Minister really ruling the country.
Our good Queen liked science very much. She circulated an order that all the",Sultanaís Dream,Rokheya Shekhawat Hossein
3652,"women in her country should be educated. Accordingly a number of girls schools
were founded and supported by the government. Education was spread far and
wide among women. And early marriage also was stopped. No woman was to be
allowed to marry before she was twenty-one. I must tell you that, before this
change we had been kept in strict purdah.",Sultanaís Dream,Rokheya Shekhawat Hossein

3655,"How the tables are turned, I interposed with a laugh.",Sultanaís Dream,Rokheya Shekhawat Hossein
3656,"But the seclusion is the same, she said. In a few years we had separate
universities, where no men were admitted.",Sultanaís Dream,Rokheya Shekhawat Hossein
3657,"In the capital, where our Queen lives, there are two universities. One of these
invented a wonderful balloon, to which they attached a number of pipes. By means
of this captive balloon which they managed to keep afloat above the cloud-land,
they could draw as much water from the atmosphere as they pleased. As the water
was incessantly being drawn by the university people no cloud gathered and the
ingenious Lady Principal stopped rain and storms thereby.",Sultanaís Dream,Rokheya Shekhawat Hossein
3658,Really! Now I understand why there is no mud here! said I. But I could not,Sultanaís Dream,Rokheya Shekhawat Hossein
3659,understand how it was possible to accumulate water in the pipes. She explained to,Sultanaís Dream,Rokheya Shekhawat Hossein
3660,"me how it was done, but I was unable to understand her, as my scientific",Sultanaís Dream,Rokheya Shekhawat Hossein
3661,"knowledge was very limited. However, she went on, When the other university
came to know of this, they became exceedingly jealous and tried to do something
more extraordinary still. They invented an instrument by which they could collect
as much sun-heat as they wanted. And they kept the heat stored up to be
distributed among others as required.
While the women were engaged in scientific research, the men of this country",Sultanaís Dream,Rokheya Shekhawat Hossein
3662,were busy increasing their military power. When they came to know that the,Sultanaís Dream,Rokheya Shekhawat Hossein
3663,female universities were able to draw water from the atmosphere and collect heat,Sultanaís Dream,Rokheya Shekhawat Hossein
3664,"from the sun, they only laughed at the members of the universities and called the",Sultanaís Dream,Rokheya Shekhawat Hossein
3665,"whole thing a sentimental nightmare!
Your achievements are very wonderful indeed! But tell me, how you managed to",Sultanaís Dream,Rokheya Shekhawat Hossein
3666,"put the men of your country into the zenana. Did you entrap them first?
No.
It is not likely that they would surrender their free and open air life of their own",Sultanaís Dream,Rokheya Shekhawat Hossein
3667,accord and confine themselves within the four walls of the zenana! They must,Sultanaís Dream,Rokheya Shekhawat Hossein
3668,"have been overpowered.
Yes, they have been!
By whom? By some lady-warriors, I suppose?
No, not by arms.
Yes, it cannot be so. Mens arms are stronger than womens. Then?

By brain.
Even their brains are bigger and heavier than womens. Are they not?",Sultanaís Dream,Rokheya Shekhawat Hossein
3669,"Yes, but what of that? An elephant also has got a bigger and heavier brain than a
man has. Yet man can enchain elephants and employ them, according to their own
wishes.",Sultanaís Dream,Rokheya Shekhawat Hossein

3671,"Womens brains are somewhat quicker than mens. Ten years ago, when the
military officers called our scientific discoveries ""a sentimental nightmare,"" some
of the young ladies wanted to say something in reply to those remarks. But both
the Lady Principals restrained them and said, they should reply not by word, but
by deed, if ever they got the opportunity. And they had not long to wait for that
opportunity.",Sultanaís Dream,Rokheya Shekhawat Hossein
3672,"How marvelous! I heartily clapped my hands. And now the proud gentlemen are
dreaming sentimental dreams themselves.",Sultanaís Dream,Rokheya Shekhawat Hossein
3673,"Soon afterwards certain persons came from a neighbouring country and took
shelter in ours. They were in trouble having committed some political offense. The
king who cared more for power than for good government asked our kind-hearted
Queen to hand them over to his officers. She refused, as it was against her
principle to turn out refugees. For this refusal the king declared war against our
country.
Our military officers sprang to their feet at once and marched out to meet the",Sultanaís Dream,Rokheya Shekhawat Hossein
3674,"enemy. The enemy however, was too strong for them. Our soldiers fought bravely,",Sultanaís Dream,Rokheya Shekhawat Hossein
3675,no doubt. But in spite of all their bravery the foreign army advanced step by step,Sultanaís Dream,Rokheya Shekhawat Hossein
3676,to invade our country.,Sultanaís Dream,Rokheya Shekhawat Hossein
3677,"Nearly all the men had gone out to fight; even a boy of sixteen was not left home.
Most of our warriors were killed, the rest driven back and the enemy came within
twenty-five miles of the capital.
A meeting of a number of wise ladies was held at the Queens palace to advise as
to what should be done to save the land. Some proposed to fight like soldiers;
others objected and said that women were not trained to fight with swords and
guns, nor were they accustomed to fighting with any weapons. A third party
regretfully remarked that they were hopelessly weak of body.

If you cannot save your country for lack of physical strength, said the Queen,",Sultanaís Dream,Rokheya Shekhawat Hossein
3678,try to do so by brain power.,Sultanaís Dream,Rokheya Shekhawat Hossein
3679,"There was a dead silence for a few minutes. Her Royal Highness said again, ""I
must commit suicide if the land and my honour are lost.""
Then the Lady Principal of the second university (who had collected sun-heat),",Sultanaís Dream,Rokheya Shekhawat Hossein
3680,"who had been silently thinking during the consultation, remarked that they were",Sultanaís Dream,Rokheya Shekhawat Hossein
3681,"all but lost, and there was little hope left for them. There was, however, one plan",Sultanaís Dream,Rokheya Shekhawat Hossein
3682,"which she would like to try, and this would be her first and last efforts; if she",Sultanaís Dream,Rokheya Shekhawat Hossein
3683,"failed in this, there would be nothing left but to commit suicide. All present",Sultanaís Dream,Rokheya Shekhawat Hossein
3684,"solemnly vowed that they would never allow themselves to be enslaved, no matter",Sultanaís Dream,Rokheya Shekhawat Hossein
3685,what happened.,Sultanaís Dream,Rokheya Shekhawat Hossein
3686,"The Queen thanked them heartily, and asked the Lady Principal to try her plan.
The Lady Principal rose again and said, ""before we go out the men must enter the
zenanas. I make this prayer for the sake of purdah."" ""Yes, of course,"" replied Her
Royal Highness.
On the following day the Queen called upon all men to retire into zenanas for the",Sultanaís Dream,Rokheya Shekhawat Hossein
3687,"sake of honour and liberty. Wounded and tired as they were, they took that order",Sultanaís Dream,Rokheya Shekhawat Hossein
3688,rather for a boon! They bowed low and entered the zenanas without uttering a,Sultanaís Dream,Rokheya Shekhawat Hossein
3689,single word of protest. They were sure that there was no hope for this country at,Sultanaís Dream,Rokheya Shekhawat Hossein
3690,all.,Sultanaís Dream,Rokheya Shekhawat Hossein
3691,"Then the Lady Principal with her two thousand students marched to the battle
field, and arriving there directed all the rays of the concentrated sunlight and heat
towards the enemy.
The heat and light were too much for them to bear. They all ran away panicstricken, not knowing in their bewilderment how to counteract that scorching heat.",Sultanaís Dream,Rokheya Shekhawat Hossein
3692,"When they fled away leaving their guns and other ammunitions of war, they were",Sultanaís Dream,Rokheya Shekhawat Hossein
3693,burnt down by means of the same sun-heat. Since then no one has tried to invade,Sultanaís Dream,Rokheya Shekhawat Hossein
3694,"our country any more.
And since then your countrymen never tried to come out of the zenana?
Yes, they wanted to be free. Some of the police commissioners and district",Sultanaís Dream,Rokheya Shekhawat Hossein
3695,magistrates sent word to the Queen to the effect that the military officers certainly,Sultanaís Dream,Rokheya Shekhawat Hossein
3696,deserved to be imprisoned for their failure; but they never neglected their duty and,Sultanaís Dream,Rokheya Shekhawat Hossein
3697,therefore they should not be punished and they prayed to be restored to their,Sultanaís Dream,Rokheya Shekhawat Hossein

3701,"Her Royal Highness sent them a circular letter intimating to them that if their
services should ever be needed they would be sent for, and that in the meanwhile
they should remain where they were. Now that they are accustomed to the purdah
system and have ceased to grumble at their seclusion, we call the system
""Mardana"" instead of ""zenana"".",Sultanaís Dream,Rokheya Shekhawat Hossein
3702,"But how do you manage, I asked Sister Sara, to do without the police or
magistrates in case of theft or murder?",Sultanaís Dream,Rokheya Shekhawat Hossein

or sin; therefore we do not require a policeman to find out a culprit, nor do we
want a magistrate to try a criminal case.",Sultanaís Dream,Rokheya Shekhawat Hossein
3704,"That is very good, indeed. I suppose if there was any dishonest person, you could
very easily chastise her. As you gained a decisive victory without shedding a
single drop of blood, you could drive off crime and criminals too without much
difficulty!",Sultanaís Dream,Rokheya Shekhawat Hossein
3705,"Now, dear Sultana, will you sit here or come to my parlour? she asked me.",Sultanaís Dream,Rokheya Shekhawat Hossein

but we must leave it now; for the gentlemen may be cursing me for keeping them",Sultanaís Dream,Rokheya Shekhawat Hossein
3707,"away from their duties in the kitchen so long. We both laughed heartily.
How my friends at home will be amused and amazed, when I go back and tell",Sultanaís Dream,Rokheya Shekhawat Hossein
3708,"them that in the far-off Ladyland, ladies rule over the country and control all social",Sultanaís Dream,Rokheya Shekhawat Hossein
3709,"matters, while gentlemen are kept in the Mardanas to mind babies, to cook and to",Sultanaís Dream,Rokheya Shekhawat Hossein
3710,do all sorts of domestic work; and that cooking is so easy a thing that it is simply a,Sultanaís Dream,Rokheya Shekhawat Hossein
3711,"pleasure to cook!
Yes, tell them about all that you see here.
Please let me know, how you carry on land cultivation and how you plough the",Sultanaís Dream,Rokheya Shekhawat Hossein
3712,"land and do other hard manual work.
Our fields are tilled by means of electricity, which supplies motive power for",Sultanaís Dream,Rokheya Shekhawat Hossein
3713,"other hard work as well, and we employ it for our aerial conveyances too. We",Sultanaís Dream,Rokheya Shekhawat Hossein
3714,"have no rail road nor any paved streets here.
Therefore neither street nor railway accidents occur here, said I. Do not you ever",Sultanaís Dream,Rokheya Shekhawat Hossein
3715,"suffer from want of rainwater? I asked.
Never since the water balloon has been set up. You see the big balloon and",Sultanaís Dream,Rokheya Shekhawat Hossein

3719,Nor do we ever suffer from flood or thunderstorms. We are all very busy making,Sultanaís Dream,Rokheya Shekhawat Hossein
3720,nature yield as much as she can. We do not find time to quarrel with one another,Sultanaís Dream,Rokheya Shekhawat Hossein
3721,as we never sit idle. Our noble Queen is exceedingly fond of botany; it is her,Sultanaís Dream,Rokheya Shekhawat Hossein
3722,"ambition to convert the whole country into one grand garden.
The idea is excellent. What is your chief food?
Fruits.
How do you keep your country cool in hot weather? We regard the rainfall in",Sultanaís Dream,Rokheya Shekhawat Hossein
3723,"summer as a blessing from heaven.
When the heat becomes unbearable, we sprinkle the ground with plentiful showers",Sultanaís Dream,Rokheya Shekhawat Hossein
3724,drawn from the artificial fountains. And in cold weather we keep our room warm,Sultanaís Dream,Rokheya Shekhawat Hossein
3725,"with sun-heat.
She showed me her bathroom, the roof of which was removable. She could enjoy a
shower bath whenever she liked, by simply removing the roof (which was like the
lid of a box) and turning on the tap of the shower pipe.
You are a lucky people! ejaculated I. You know no want. What is your religion,",Sultanaís Dream,Rokheya Shekhawat Hossein
3726,"may I ask?
Our religion is based on Love and Truth. It is our religious duty to love one",Sultanaís Dream,Rokheya Shekhawat Hossein
3727,"another and to be absolutely truthful. If any person lies, she or he is....
Punished with death?
No, not with death. We do not take pleasure in killing a creature of God,",Sultanaís Dream,Rokheya Shekhawat Hossein
3728,especially a human being. The liar is asked to leave this land for good and never to,Sultanaís Dream,Rokheya Shekhawat Hossein
3729,"come to it again.
Is an offender never forgiven?
Yes, if that person repents sincerely.
Are you not allowed to see any man, except your own relations?
No one except sacred relations.
Our circle of sacred relations is very limited; even first cousins are not sacred.
But ours is very large; a distant cousin is as sacred as a brother.

That is very good. I see purity itself reigns over your land. I should like to see the",Sultanaís Dream,Rokheya Shekhawat Hossein
3730,"good Queen, who is so sagacious and far-sighted and who has made all these",Sultanaís Dream,Rokheya Shekhawat Hossein
3731,"rules.
All right, said Sister Sara.
Then she screwed a couple of seats onto a square piece of plank. To this plank she
attached two smooth and well-polished balls. When I asked her what the balls
were for, she said they were hydrogen balls and they were used to overcome the
force of gravity. The balls were of different capacities to be used according to the
different weights desired to be overcome. She then fastened to the air-car two
wing-like blades, which, she said, were worked by electricity. After we were
comfortably seated she touched a knob and the blades began to whirl, moving
faster and faster every moment. At first we were raised to the height of about six
or seven feet and then off we flew. And before I could realize that we had
commenced moving, we reached the garden of the Queen.
My friend lowered the air-car by reversing the action of the machine, and when
the car touched the ground the machine was stopped and we got out.
I had seen from the air-car the Queen walking on a garden path with her little
daughter (who was four years old) and her maids of honour.
Halloo! You here! cried the Queen addressing Sister Sara. I was introduced to
Her Royal Highness and was received by her cordially without any ceremony.
I was very much delighted to make her acquaintance. In the course of the
conversation I had with her, the Queen told me that she had no objection to
permitting her subjects to trade with other countries. But, she continued, no trade",Sultanaís Dream,Rokheya Shekhawat Hossein
3732,was possible with countries where the women were kept in the zenanas and so,Sultanaís Dream,Rokheya Shekhawat Hossein
3733,"unable to come and trade with us. Men, we find, are rather of lower morals and so",Sultanaís Dream,Rokheya Shekhawat Hossein
3734,"we do not like dealing with them. We do not covet other peoples land, we do not
fight for a piece of diamond though it may be a thousand-fold brighter than the
Koh-i-Noor, nor do we grudge a ruler his Peacock Throne. We dive deep into the
ocean of knowledge and try to find out the precious gems, which nature has kept
in store for us. We enjoy natures gifts as much as we can.
After taking leave of the Queen, I visited the famous universities, and was shown
some of their manufactories, laboratories and observatories.
After visiting the above places of interest we got again into the air-car, but as soon
as it began moving, I somehow slipped down and the fall startled me out of my

dream. And on opening my eyes, I found myself in my own bedroom still
lounging in the easy-chair!

3753,Nobody will ever believe how they looked. Descriptions aren't any good,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
3754,"when it comes to women, and I never was good at descriptions anyhow. But",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
3755,it's got to be done somehow; the rest of the world needs to know about,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
3756,that country.,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
3757,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
3758,"I haven't said where it was for fear some self-appointed missionaries,",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"

3766,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
3767,"We had known each other years and years, and in spite of our differences",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
3768,we had a good deal in common. All of us were interested in science.,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
3769,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
3770,Terry was rich enough to do as he pleased. His great aim was,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
3771,exploration. He used to make all kinds of a row because there was,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
3772,"nothing left to explore now, only patchwork and filling in, he said. He",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
3773,filled in well enough--he had a lot of talents--great on mechanics and,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
3774,"electricity. Had all kinds of boats and motorcars, and was one of the",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"

3786,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
3787,Terry was strong on facts--geography and meteorology and those; Jeff,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
3788,"could beat him any time on biology, and I didn't care what it was they",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"

3790,are few things that don't.,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
3791,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
3792,We three had a chance to join a big scientific expedition. They needed,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
3793,"a doctor, and that gave Jeff an excuse for dropping his just opening",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
3794,"practice; they needed Terry's experience, his machine, and his money;",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
3795,"and as for me, I got in through Terry's influence.",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
3796,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
3797,The expedition was up among the thousand tributaries and enormous,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"

3803,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
3804,My interest was first roused by talk among our guides. I'm quick at,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"

3818,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
3819,"None of them had ever seen it. It was dangerous, deadly, they said, for",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"

3825,no place for men--of that they seemed sure.,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
3826,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
3827,"I told the boys about these stories, and they laughed at them. Naturally",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
3828,I did myself. I knew the stuff that savage dreams are made of.,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
3829,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
3830,"But when we had reached our farthest point, just the day before we all",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"

3840,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"

3862,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
3863,"""Let's go,"" urged Terry. ""Just us three. Maybe we can really find",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"

3866,"""May be indigo,"" Jeff suggested, with his lazy smile.",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
3867,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
3868,It was early yet; we had just breakfasted; and leaving word that we'd,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
3869,"be back before night, we got away quietly, not wishing to be thought",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
3870,"too gullible if we failed, and secretly hoping to have some nice little",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
3871,discovery all to ourselves.,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
3872,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
3873,"It was a long two hours, nearer three. I fancy the savage could have",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
3874,done it alone much quicker. There was a desperate tangle of wood and,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
3875,water and a swampy patch we never should have found our way across,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"

3878,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
3879,"We came after a while to a sort of marshy lake, very big, so that the",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"

3882,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"

3885,"the ground growing firmer as we advanced, and presently we turned the",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
3886,corner of a wooded promontory and saw a quite different country--a,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
3887,"sudden view of mountains, steep and bare.",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
3888,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
3889,"""One of those long easterly spurs,"" Terry said appraisingly. ""May be",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"

3891,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
3892,Suddenly we left the lake and struck directly toward the cliffs. We,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
3893,"heard running water before we reached it, and the guide pointed proudly",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
3894,to his river.,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
3895,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
3896,It was short. We could see where it poured down a narrow vertical,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
3897,cataract from an opening in the face of the cliff. It was sweet water.,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
3898,The guide drank eagerly and so did we.,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"

3902,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
3903,But as to being red and blue--it was greenish in tint. The guide seemed,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
3904,not at all surprised. He hunted about a little and showed us a quiet,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
3905,"marginal pool where there were smears of red along the border; yes, and",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
3906,of blue.,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
3907,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
3908,Terry got out his magnifying glass and squatted down to investigate.,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"

3912,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
3913,We scrambled along the steep banks and got close to the pool that foamed,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
3914,and boiled beneath the falling water. Here we searched the border and,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
3915,found traces of color beyond dispute. More--Jeff suddenly held up an,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
3916,unlooked-for trophy.,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
3917,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
3918,"It was only a rag, a long, raveled fragment of cloth. But it was a",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
3919,"well-woven fabric, with a pattern, and of a clear scarlet that the water",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
3920,had not faded. No savage tribe that we had heard of made such fabrics.,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"

3929,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
3930,Then we were interested. We had our rest and lunch right there and,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
3931,pumped the man for further information. He could tell us only what the,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
3932,"others had--a land of women--no men--babies, but all girls. No place for",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"

3934,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
3935,I could see Terry's jaw set at that. No place for men? Dangerous? He,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
3936,looked as if he might shin up the waterfall on the spot. But the guide,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
3937,"would not hear of going up, even if there had been any possible method",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
3938,"of scaling that sheer cliff, and we had to get back to our party before",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"

4043,"one--was just blossoming with roses and babies and canaries and tidies,",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4044,and all that sort of thing.,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4045,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4046,"And Terry, in his secret heart, had visions of a sort of sublimated",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4047,summer resort--just Girls and Girls and Girls--and that he was going to,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4048,"be--well, Terry was popular among women even when there were other men",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4049,"around, and it's not to be wondered at that he had pleasant dreams of",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4050,"what might happen. I could see it in his eyes as he lay there, looking",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4051,"at the long blue rollers slipping by, and fingering that impressive",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4052,mustache of his.,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4053,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4054,But I thought--then--that I could form a far clearer idea of what was,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4055,before us than either of them.,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4056,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4057,"""You're all off, boys,"" I insisted. ""If there is such a place--and there",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4058,does seem some foundation for believing it--you'll find it's built on a,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4059,"sort of matriarchal principle, that's all. The men have a separate cult",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4060,"of their own, less socially developed than the women, and make them an",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4061,annual visit--a sort of wedding call. This is a condition known to have,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4062,existed--here's just a survival. They've got some peculiarly isolated,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4063,"valley or tableland up there, and their primeval customs have survived.",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4064,"That's all there is to it.""",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4065,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4066,"""How about the boys?"" Jeff asked.",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4067,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4068,"""Oh, the men take them away as soon as they are five or six, you see.""",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"

4071,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4072,"""Danger enough, Terry, and we'll have to be mighty careful. Women of",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4073,that stage of culture are quite able to defend themselves and have no,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4074,"welcome for unseasonable visitors.""",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4075,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4076,We talked and talked.,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4077,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4078,And with all my airs of sociological superiority I was no nearer than,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4079,any of them.,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4080,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4081,"It was funny though, in the light of what we did find, those extremely",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4082,clear ideas of ours as to what a country of women would be like. It,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4083,was no use to tell ourselves and one another that all this was idle,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4084,"speculation. We were idle and we did speculate, on the ocean voyage and",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4085,"the river voyage, too.",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4086,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4087,"""Admitting the improbability,"" we'd begin solemnly, and then launch out",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4088,again.,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4089,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4090,"""They would fight among themselves,"" Terry insisted. ""Women always do.",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4091,"We mustn't look to find any sort of order and organization.""",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4092,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4093,"""You're dead wrong,"" Jeff told him. ""It will be like a nunnery under an",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4094,"abbess--a peaceful, harmonious sisterhood.""",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4095,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4096,I snorted derision at this idea.,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4097,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4098,"""Nuns, indeed! Your peaceful sisterhoods were all celibate, Jeff, and",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4099,"under vows of obedience. These are just women, and mothers, and where",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4100,"there's motherhood you don't find sisterhood--not much.""",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4101,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4102,"""No, sir--they'll scrap,"" agreed Terry. ""Also we mustn't look for",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4103,"inventions and progress; it'll be awfully primitive.""",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4104,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"

4106,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4107,"""Oh, cloth! Women have always been spinsters. But there they",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4108,"stop--you'll see.""",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4109,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4110,We joked Terry about his modest impression that he would be warmly,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4111,"received, but he held his ground.",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4112,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4113,"""You'll see,"" he insisted. ""I'll get solid with them all--and play one",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4114,bunch against another. I'll get myself elected king in no time--whew!,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4115,"Solomon will have to take a back seat!""",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4116,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4117,"""Where do we come in on that deal?"" I demanded. ""Aren't we Viziers or",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4118,"anything?""",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4119,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4120,"""Couldn't risk it,"" he asserted solemnly. ""You might start a",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4121,"revolution--probably would. No, you'll have to be beheaded, or",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4122,"bowstrung--or whatever the popular method of execution is.""",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4123,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4124,"""You'd have to do it yourself, remember,"" grinned Jeff. ""No husky black",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"

4126,"Van?""",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4127,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4128,Jeff's ideas and Terry's were so far apart that sometimes it was all,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4129,I could do to keep the peace between them. Jeff idealized women in the,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4130,"best Southern style. He was full of chivalry and sentiment, and all",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4131,that. And he was a good boy; he lived up to his ideals.,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4132,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4133,"You might say Terry did, too, if you can call his views about women",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4134,"anything so polite as ideals. I always liked Terry. He was a man's man,",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4135,"very much so, generous and brave and clever; but I don't think any of",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4136,us in college days was quite pleased to have him with our sisters. We,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4137,"weren't very stringent, heavens no! But Terry was ""the limit."" Later",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4138,"on--why, of course a man's life is his own, we held, and asked no",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4139,questions.,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4140,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4141,"But barring a possible exception in favor of a not impossible wife, or",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4142,"of his mother, or, of course, the fair relatives of his friends, Terry's",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4143,idea seemed to be that pretty women were just so much game and homely,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4144,ones not worth considering.,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4145,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4146,It was really unpleasant sometimes to see the notions he had.,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4147,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4148,"But I got out of patience with Jeff, too. He had such rose-colored halos",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4149,"on his womenfolks. I held a middle ground, highly scientific, of course,",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4150,and used to argue learnedly about the physiological limitations of the,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4151,sex.,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4152,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4153,"We were not in the least ""advanced"" on the woman question, any of us,",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4154,then.,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4155,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4156,"So we joked and disputed and speculated, and after an interminable",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4157,"journey, we got to our old camping place at last.",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4158,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4159,"It was not hard to find the river, just poking along that side till we",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4160,"came to it, and it was navigable as far as the lake.",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4161,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4162,"When we reached that and slid out on its broad glistening bosom, with",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4163,"that high gray promontory running out toward us, and the straight white",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4164,"fall clearly visible, it began to be really exciting.",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4165,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4166,"There was some talk, even then, of skirting the rock wall and seeking",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4167,"a possible footway up, but the marshy jungle made that method look not",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4168,only difficult but dangerous.,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4169,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4170,Terry dismissed the plan sharply.,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4171,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4172,"""Nonsense, fellows! We've decided that. It might take months--we haven't",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4173,"got the provisions. No, sir--we've got to take our chances. If we get",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4174,"back safe--all right. If we don't, why, we're not the first explorers to",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4175,"get lost in the shuffle. There are plenty to come after us.""",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4176,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4177,So we got the big biplane together and loaded it with our scientifically,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4178,"compressed baggage: the camera, of course; the glasses; a supply of",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4179,"concentrated food. Our pockets were magazines of small necessities, and",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4180,"we had our guns, of course--there was no knowing what might happen.",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4181,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4182,"Up and up and up we sailed, way up at first, to get ""the lay of the",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4183,"land"" and make note of it.",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4184,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4185,Out of that dark green sea of crowding forest this high-standing spur,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4186,"rose steeply. It ran back on either side, apparently, to the far-off",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4187,"white-crowned peaks in the distance, themselves probably inaccessible.",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4188,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4189,"""Let's make the first trip geographical,"" I suggested. ""Spy out the",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4190,"land, and drop back here for more gasoline. With your tremendous speed",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4191,we can reach that range and back all right. Then we can leave a sort of,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4192,"map on board--for that relief expedition.""",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4193,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4194,"""There's sense in that,"" Terry agreed. ""I'll put off being king of",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4195,"Ladyland for one more day.""",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4196,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4197,"So we made a long skirting voyage, turned the point of the cape which",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4198,"was close by, ran up one side of the triangle at our best speed, crossed",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4199,"over the base where it left the higher mountains, and so back to our",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4200,lake by moonlight.,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4201,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4202,"""That's not a bad little kingdom,"" we agreed when it was roughly drawn",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4203,and measured. We could tell the size fairly by our speed. And from what,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4204,"we could see of the sides--and that icy ridge at the back end--""It's a",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4205,"pretty enterprising savage who would manage to get into it,"" Jeff said.",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4206,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4207,"Of course we had looked at the land itself--eagerly, but we were too",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4208,high and going too fast to see much. It appeared to be well forested,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4209,"about the edges, but in the interior there were wide plains, and",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4210,everywhere parklike meadows and open places.,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4211,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4212,"There were cities, too; that I insisted. It looked--well, it looked like",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4213,"any other country--a civilized one, I mean.",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4214,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4215,"We had to sleep after that long sweep through the air, but we turned out",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4216,"early enough next day, and again we rose softly up the height till",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4217,we could top the crowning trees and see the broad fair land at our,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4218,pleasure.,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4219,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4220,"""Semitropical. Looks like a first-rate climate. It's wonderful what a",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4221,"little height will do for temperature."" Terry was studying the forest",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4222,growth.,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4223,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4224,"""Little height! Is that what you call little?"" I asked. Our instruments",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4225,measured it clearly. We had not realized the long gentle rise from the,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4226,coast perhaps.,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4227,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4228,"""Mighty lucky piece of land, I call it,"" Terry pursued. ""Now for the",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4229,"folks--I've had enough scenery.""",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4230,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4231,"So we sailed low, crossing back and forth, quartering the country as we",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4232,"went, and studying it. We saw--I can't remember now how much of this we",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4233,"noted then and how much was supplemented by our later knowledge, but we",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4234,"could not help seeing this much, even on that excited day--a land in a",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4235,"state of perfect cultivation, where even the forests looked as if they",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4236,"were cared for; a land that looked like an enormous park, only it was",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4237,even more evidently an enormous garden.,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4238,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4239,"""I don't see any cattle,"" I suggested, but Terry was silent. We were",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4240,approaching a village.,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4241,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4242,"I confess that we paid small attention to the clean, well-built roads,",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4243,"to the attractive architecture, to the ordered beauty of the little",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4244,"town. We had our glasses out; even Terry, setting his machine for a",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4245,"spiral glide, clapped the binoculars to his eyes.",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4246,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4247,They heard our whirring screw. They ran out of the houses--they gathered,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4248,"in from the fields, swift-running light figures, crowds of them. We",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4249,"stared and stared until it was almost too late to catch the levers,",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4250,sweep off and rise again; and then we held our peace for a long run,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4251,upward.,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4252,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4253,"""Gosh!"" said Terry, after a while.",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4254,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4255,"""Only women there--and children,"" Jeff urged excitedly.",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4256,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4257,"""But they look--why, this is a CIVILIZED country!"" I protested. ""There",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4258,"must be men.""",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4259,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4260,"""Of course there are men,"" said Terry. ""Come on, let's find 'em.""",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4261,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4262,He refused to listen to Jeff's suggestion that we examine the country,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4263,further before we risked leaving our machine.,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4264,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4265,"""There's a fine landing place right there where we came over,"" he",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4266,"insisted, and it was an excellent one--a wide, flat-topped rock,",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4267,"overlooking the lake, and quite out of sight from the interior.",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4268,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4269,"""They won't find this in a hurry,"" he asserted, as we scrambled with the",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4270,"utmost difficulty down to safer footing. ""Come on, boys--there were some",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4271,"good lookers in that bunch.""",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4272,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4273,Of course it was unwise of us.,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4274,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4275,It was quite easy to see afterward that our best plan was to have,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4276,studied the country more fully before we left our swooping airship and,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4277,trusted ourselves to mere foot service. But we were three young men. We,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4278,"had been talking about this country for over a year, hardly believing",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4279,"that there was such a place, and now--we were in it.",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4280,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4281,"It looked safe and civilized enough, and among those upturned, crowding",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4282,"faces, though some were terrified enough, there was great beauty--on",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4283,that we all agreed.,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4284,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4285,"""Come on!"" cried Terry, pushing forward. ""Oh, come on! Here goes for",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"

4293,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4294,Not more than ten or fifteen miles we judged it from our landing rock to,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"

4296,the woods and go carefully.,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4297,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4298,Even Terry's ardor was held in check by his firm conviction that there,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4299,"were men to be met, and we saw to it that each of us had a good stock of",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4300,cartridges.,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4301,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4302,"""They may be scarce, and they may be hidden away somewhere--some kind of",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"

4304,in the mountains yonder and keep the women in this part of the,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"

4306,"you see the babies?""",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4307,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4308,"We had all seen babies, children big and little, everywhere that we had",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4309,come near enough to distinguish the people. And though by dress we could,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4310,"not be sure of all the grown persons, still there had not been one man",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4311,that we were certain of.,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"

4313,"""I always liked that Arab saying, 'First tie your camel and then trust",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"

4317,"""Talk of civilization,"" he cried softly in restrained enthusiasm. ""I",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"

4320,"looked about him, calling Jeff's attention to the kinds of trees.",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4321,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4322,They left me for a landmark and made a limited excursion on either side.,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4323,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4324,"""Food-bearing, practically all of them,"" they announced returning. ""The",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"

4326,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4327,"""Good thing to have a botanist on hand,"" I agreed. ""Sure there are no",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4328,"medicinal ones? Or any for pure ornament?""",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4329,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4330,As a matter of fact they were quite right. These towering trees were,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4331,under as careful cultivation as so many cabbages. In other conditions,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4332,we should have found those woods full of fair foresters and fruit,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4333,"gatherers; but an airship is a conspicuous object, and by no means",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"

4336,"All we found moving in those woods, as we started through them, were",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4337,"birds, some gorgeous, some musical, all so tame that it seemed almost",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4338,to contradict our theory of cultivation--at least until we came upon,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4339,"occasional little glades, where carved stone seats and tables stood in",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4340,"the shade beside clear fountains, with shallow bird baths always added.",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4341,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4342,"""They don't kill birds, and apparently they do kill cats,"" Terry",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4343,"declared. ""MUST be men here. Hark!""",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4344,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4345,"We had heard something: something not in the least like a birdsong, and",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4346,"very much like a suppressed whisper of laughter--a little happy sound,",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4347,"instantly smothered. We stood like so many pointers, and then used our",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4348,"glasses, swiftly, carefully.",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4349,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4350,"""It couldn't have been far off,"" said Terry excitedly. ""How about this",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4351,"big tree?""",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4352,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4353,There was a very large and beautiful tree in the glade we had just,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4354,"entered, with thick wide-spreading branches that sloped out in lapping",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4355,fans like a beech or pine. It was trimmed underneath some twenty feet,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4356,"up, and stood there like a huge umbrella, with circling seats beneath.",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4357,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4358,"""Look,"" he pursued. ""There are short stumps of branches left to climb",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4359,"on. There's someone up that tree, I believe.""",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4360,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4361,"We stole near, cautiously.",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4362,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4363,"""Look out for a poisoned arrow in your eye,"" I suggested, but Terry",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4364,"pressed forward, sprang up on the seat-back, and grasped the trunk. ""In",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4365,"my heart, more likely,"" he answered. ""Gee! Look, boys!""",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4366,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4367,We rushed close in and looked up. There among the boughs overhead was,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4368,"something--more than one something--that clung motionless, close to the",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4369,"great trunk at first, and then, as one and all we started up the tree,",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4370,separated into three swift-moving figures and fled upward. As we climbed,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4371,we could catch glimpses of them scattering above us. By the time we had,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4372,"reached about as far as three men together dared push, they had left the",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4373,"main trunk and moved outward, each one balanced on a long branch that",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4374,dipped and swayed beneath the weight.,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4375,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4376,"We paused uncertain. If we pursued further, the boughs would break under",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4377,"the double burden. We might shake them off, perhaps, but none of us was",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4378,"so inclined. In the soft dappled light of these high regions, breathless",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4379,"with our rapid climb, we rested awhile, eagerly studying our objects",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4380,"of pursuit; while they in turn, with no more terror than a set of",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4381,"frolicsome children in a game of tag, sat as lightly as so many big",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4382,"bright birds on their precarious perches and frankly, curiously, stared",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4383,at us.,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4384,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4385,"""Girls!"" whispered Jeff, under his breath, as if they might fly if he",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4386,spoke aloud.,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4387,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4388,"""Peaches!"" added Terry, scarcely louder.",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4389,"""Peacherinos--apricot-nectarines! Whew!""",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4390,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4391,"They were girls, of course, no boys could ever have shown that sparkling",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4392,"beauty, and yet none of us was certain at first.",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4393,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4394,"We saw short hair, hatless, loose, and shining; a suit of some light",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4395,"firm stuff, the closest of tunics and kneebreeches, met by trim gaiters.",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4396,"As bright and smooth as parrots and as unaware of danger, they swung",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4397,"there before us, wholly at ease, staring as we stared, till first one,",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4398,and then all of them burst into peals of delighted laughter.,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4399,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4400,Then there was a torrent of soft talk tossed back and forth; no savage,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4401,"sing-song, but clear musical fluent speech.",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4402,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4403,"We met their laughter cordially, and doffed our hats to them, at which",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4404,"they laughed again, delightedly.",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4405,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4406,"Then Terry, wholly in his element, made a polite speech, with",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4407,"explanatory gestures, and proceeded to introduce us, with pointing",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4408,"finger. ""Mr. Jeff Margrave,"" he said clearly; Jeff bowed as gracefully",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4409,"as a man could in the fork of a great limb. ""Mr. Vandyck Jennings""--I",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4410,also tried to make an effective salute and nearly lost my balance.,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4411,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4412,"Then Terry laid his hand upon his chest--a fine chest he had, too,",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4413,and introduced himself; he was braced carefully for the occasion and,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4414,achieved an excellent obeisance.,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4415,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4416,"Again they laughed delightedly, and the one nearest me followed his",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4417,tactics.,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4418,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4419,"""Celis,"" she said distinctly, pointing to the one in blue; ""Alima""--the",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4420,"one in rose; then, with a vivid imitation of Terry's impressive manner,",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4421,"she laid a firm delicate hand on her gold-green jerkin--""Ellador."" This",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4422,"was pleasant, but we got no nearer.",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4423,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4424,"""We can't sit here and learn the language,"" Terry protested. He beckoned",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4425,"to them to come nearer, most winningly--but they gaily shook their",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4426,"heads. He suggested, by signs, that we all go down together; but again",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4427,"they shook their heads, still merrily. Then Ellador clearly indicated",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4428,"that we should go down, pointing to each and all of us, with",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4429,unmistakable firmness; and further seeming to imply by the sweep of a,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4430,"lithe arm that we not only go downward, but go away altogether--at which",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4431,we shook our heads in turn.,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4432,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4433,"""Have to use bait,"" grinned Terry. ""I don't know about you fellows,",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4434,"but I came prepared."" He produced from an inner pocket a little box of",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4435,"purple velvet, that opened with a snap--and out of it he drew a long",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4436,"sparkling thing, a necklace of big varicolored stones that would have",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4437,"been worth a million if real ones. He held it up, swung it, glittering",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4438,"in the sun, offered it first to one, then to another, holding it out as",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4439,far as he could reach toward the girl nearest him. He stood braced,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4440,"in the fork, held firmly by one hand--the other, swinging his bright",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4441,"temptation, reached far out along the bough, but not quite to his full",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4442,stretch.,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4443,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4444,"She was visibly moved, I noted, hesitated, spoke to her companions.",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4445,"They chattered softly together, one evidently warning her, the other",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4446,"encouraging. Then, softly and slowly, she drew nearer. This was Alima,",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4447,"a tall long-limbed lass, well-knit and evidently both strong and agile.",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4448,"Her eyes were splendid, wide, fearless, as free from suspicion as a",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4449,child's who has never been rebuked. Her interest was more that of,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4450,an intent boy playing a fascinating game than of a girl lured by an,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4451,ornament.,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4452,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4453,"The others moved a bit farther out, holding firmly, watching. Terry's",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4454,"smile was irreproachable, but I did not like the look in his eyes--it",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4455,was like a creature about to spring. I could already see it happen--the,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4456,"dropped necklace, the sudden clutching hand, the girl's sharp cry as he",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4457,seized her and drew her in. But it didn't happen. She made a timid reach,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4458,with her right hand for the gay swinging thing--he held it a little,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4459,"nearer--then, swift as light, she seized it from him with her left, and",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4460,dropped on the instant to the bough below.,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4461,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4462,"He made his snatch, quite vainly, almost losing his position as his",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4463,"hand clutched only air; and then, with inconceivable rapidity, the three",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4464,bright creatures were gone. They dropped from the ends of the big boughs,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4465,"to those below, fairly pouring themselves off the tree, while we climbed",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4466,"downward as swiftly as we could. We heard their vanishing gay laughter,",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4467,"we saw them fleeting away in the wide open reaches of the forest, and",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4468,"gave chase, but we might as well have chased wild antelopes; so we",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4469,stopped at length somewhat breathless.,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4470,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4471,"""No use,"" gasped Terry. ""They got away with it. My word! The men of this",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4472,"country must be good sprinters!""",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4473,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4474,"""Inhabitants evidently arboreal,"" I grimly suggested. ""Civilized and",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4475,"still arboreal--peculiar people.""",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4476,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4477,"""You shouldn't have tried that way,"" Jeff protested. ""They were",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4478,"perfectly friendly; now we've scared them.""",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4479,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4480,"But it was no use grumbling, and Terry refused to admit any mistake.",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4481,"""Nonsense,"" he said. ""They expected it. Women like to be run after. Come",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4482,"on, let's get to that town; maybe we'll find them there. Let's see, it",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4483,"was in this direction and not far from the woods, as I remember.""",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4484,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4485,When we reached the edge of the open country we reconnoitered with our,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4486,"field glasses. There it was, about four miles off, the same town, we",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4487,"concluded, unless, as Jeff ventured, they all had pink houses. The broad",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4488,"green fields and closely cultivated gardens sloped away at our feet, a",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4489,"long easy slant, with good roads winding pleasantly here and there, and",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4490,narrower paths besides.,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4491,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4492,"""Look at that!"" cried Jeff suddenly. ""There they go!""",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4493,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4494,"Sure enough, close to the town, across a wide meadow, three bright-hued",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4495,figures were running swiftly.,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4496,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4497,"""How could they have got that far in this time? It can't be the same",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4498,"ones,"" I urged. But through the glasses we could identify our pretty",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4499,"tree-climbers quite plainly, at least by costume.",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4500,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4501,"Terry watched them, we all did for that matter, till they disappeared",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4502,"among the houses. Then he put down his glass and turned to us, drawing",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4503,"a long breath. ""Mother of Mike, boys--what Gorgeous Girls! To climb like",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4504,that! to run like that! and afraid of nothing. This country suits me all,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4505,"right. Let's get ahead.""",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4506,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4507,"""Nothing venture, nothing have,"" I suggested, but Terry preferred ""Faint",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4508,"heart ne'er won fair lady.""",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4509,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4510,"We set forth in the open, walking briskly. ""If there are any men, we'd",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4511,"better keep an eye out,"" I suggested, but Jeff seemed lost in heavenly",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4512,"dreams, and Terry in highly practical plans.",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4513,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4514,"""What a perfect road! What a heavenly country! See the flowers, will",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4515,"you?""",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4516,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4517,"This was Jeff, always an enthusiast; but we could agree with him fully.",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4518,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4519,"The road was some sort of hard manufactured stuff, sloped slightly to",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4520,"shed rain, with every curve and grade and gutter as perfect as if it",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4521,"were Europe's best. ""No men, eh?"" sneered Terry. On either side a double",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4522,"row of trees shaded the footpaths; between the trees bushes or vines,",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4523,"all fruit-bearing, now and then seats and little wayside fountains;",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4524,everywhere flowers.,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4525,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4526,"""We'd better import some of these ladies and set 'em to parking the",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4527,"United States,"" I suggested. ""Mighty nice place they've got here."" We",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4528,"rested a few moments by one of the fountains, tested the fruit that",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4529,"looked ripe, and went on, impressed, for all our gay bravado by the",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4530,sense of quiet potency which lay about us.,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4531,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4532,"Here was evidently a people highly skilled, efficient, caring for their",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4533,country as a florist cares for his costliest orchids. Under the soft,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4534,"brilliant blue of that clear sky, in the pleasant shade of those endless",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4535,"rows of trees, we walked unharmed, the placid silence broken only by the",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4536,birds.,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4537,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4538,Presently there lay before us at the foot of a long hill the town or,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4539,village we were aiming for. We stopped and studied it.,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4540,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4541,"Jeff drew a long breath. ""I wouldn't have believed a collection of",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4542,"houses could look so lovely,"" he said.",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4543,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4544,"""They've got architects and landscape gardeners in plenty, that's sure,""",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4545,agreed Terry.,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4546,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4547,"I was astonished myself. You see, I come from California, and there's no",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4548,"country lovelier, but when it comes to towns--! I have often groaned",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4549,"at home to see the offensive mess man made in the face of nature, even",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4550,"though I'm no art sharp, like Jeff. But this place! It was built mostly",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4551,"of a sort of dull rose-colored stone, with here and there some clear",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4552,white houses; and it lay abroad among the green groves and gardens like,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4553,a broken rosary of pink coral.,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4554,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4555,"""Those big white ones are public buildings evidently,"" Terry declared.",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4556,"""This is no savage country, my friend. But no men? Boys, it behooves us",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4557,"to go forward most politely.""",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4558,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4559,"The place had an odd look, more impressive as we approached. ""It's like",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4560,"an exposition."" ""It's too pretty to be true."" ""Plenty of palaces, but",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4561,"where are the homes?"" ""Oh there are little ones enough--but--."" It",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4562,certainly was different from any towns we had ever seen.,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4563,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4564,"""There's no dirt,"" said Jeff suddenly. ""There's no smoke,"" he added",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4565,after a little.,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4566,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4567,"""There's no noise,"" I offered; but Terry snubbed me--""That's because",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4568,"they are laying low for us; we'd better be careful how we go in there.""",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4569,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4570,"Nothing could induce him to stay out, however, so we walked on.",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4571,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4572,"Everything was beauty, order, perfect cleanness, and the pleasantest",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4573,sense of home over it all. As we neared the center of the town the,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4574,"houses stood thicker, ran together as it were, grew into rambling",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4575,"palaces grouped among parks and open squares, something as college",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4576,buildings stand in their quiet greens.,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4577,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4578,"And then, turning a corner, we came into a broad paved space and",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4579,"saw before us a band of women standing close together in even order,",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4580,evidently waiting for us.,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4581,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4582,We stopped a moment and looked back. The street behind was closed by,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4583,"another band, marching steadily, shoulder to shoulder. We went",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4584,on--there seemed no other way to go--and presently found ourselves quite,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4585,"surrounded by this close-massed multitude, women, all of them, but--",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4586,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4587,"They were not young. They were not old. They were not, in the girl",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4588,"sense, beautiful. They were not in the least ferocious. And yet, as I",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4589,"looked from face to face, calm, grave, wise, wholly unafraid, evidently",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4590,"assured and determined, I had the funniest feeling--a very early",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4591,feeling--a feeling that I traced back and back in memory until I caught,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4592,up with it at last. It was that sense of being hopelessly in the wrong,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4593,that I had so often felt in early youth when my short legs' utmost,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4594,effort failed to overcome the fact that I was late to school.,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4595,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4596,"Jeff felt it too; I could see he did. We felt like small boys, very",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4597,"small boys, caught doing mischief in some gracious lady's house. But",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4598,Terry showed no such consciousness. I saw his quick eyes darting here,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4599,"and there, estimating numbers, measuring distances, judging chances of",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4600,"escape. He examined the close ranks about us, reaching back far on every",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4601,"side, and murmured softly to me, ""Every one of 'em over forty as I'm a",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4602,"sinner.""",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4603,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4604,"Yet they were not old women. Each was in the full bloom of rosy health,",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4605,"erect, serene, standing sure-footed and light as any pugilist. They had",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4606,"no weapons, and we had, but we had no wish to shoot.",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4607,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4608,"""I'd as soon shoot my aunts,"" muttered Terry again. ""What do they",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4609,"want with us anyhow? They seem to mean business."" But in spite of that",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4610,"businesslike aspect, he determined to try his favorite tactics. Terry",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4611,had come armed with a theory.,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4612,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4613,"He stepped forward, with his brilliant ingratiating smile, and made low",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4614,"obeisance to the women before him. Then he produced another tribute, a",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4615,"broad soft scarf of filmy texture, rich in color and pattern, a lovely",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4616,"thing, even to my eye, and offered it with a deep bow to the tall",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4617,unsmiling woman who seemed to head the ranks before him. She took it,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4618,"with a gracious nod of acknowledgment, and passed it on to those behind",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4619,her.,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"

4621,"He tried again, this time bringing out a circlet of rhinestones, a",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4622,glittering crown that should have pleased any woman on earth. He made a,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4623,"brief address, including Jeff and me as partners in his enterprise, and",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4624,"with another bow presented this. Again his gift was accepted and, as",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4625,"before, passed out of sight.",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4626,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4627,"""If they were only younger,"" he muttered between his teeth. ""What on",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4628,"earth is a fellow to say to a regiment of old Colonels like this?""",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4629,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4630,In all our discussions and speculations we had always unconsciously,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4631,"assumed that the women, whatever else they might be, would be young.",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"

4635,"older they pass off the stage, somehow, into private ownership mostly,",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4636,or out of it altogether. But these good ladies were very much on the,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4637,"stage, and yet any one of them might have been a grandmother.",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4638,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4639,We looked for nervousness--there was none.,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4640,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4641,"For terror, perhaps--there was none.",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4642,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4643,"For uneasiness, for curiosity, for excitement--and all we saw was what",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4644,"might have been a vigilance committee of women doctors, as cool as",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4645,"cucumbers, and evidently meaning to take us to task for being there.",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4646,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4647,"Six of them stepped forward now, one on either side of each of us, and",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4648,"indicated that we were to go with them. We thought it best to accede, at",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4649,"first anyway, and marched along, one of these close at each elbow, and",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4650,"the others in close masses before, behind, on both sides.",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4651,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4652,"A large building opened before us, a very heavy thick-walled impressive",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4653,"place, big, and old-looking; of gray stone, not like the rest of the",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4654,town.,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4655,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4656,"""This won't do!"" said Terry to us, quickly. ""We mustn't let them get us",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4657,"in this, boys. All together, now--""",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4658,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4659,"We stopped in our tracks. We began to explain, to make signs pointing",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4660,away toward the big forest--indicating that we would go back to it--at,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4661,once.,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4662,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4663,"It makes me laugh, knowing all I do now, to think of us three",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4664,boys--nothing else; three audacious impertinent boys--butting into an,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4665,unknown country without any sort of a guard or defense. We seemed to,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4666,"think that if there were men we could fight them, and if there were only",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4667,"women--why, they would be no obstacles at all.",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4668,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4669,"Jeff, with his gentle romantic old-fashioned notions of women as",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4670,"clinging vines. Terry, with his clear decided practical theories that",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4671,there were two kinds of women--those he wanted and those he didn't;,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4672,Desirable and Undesirable was his demarcation. The latter as a large,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4673,"class, but negligible--he had never thought about them at all.",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4674,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4675,"And now here they were, in great numbers, evidently indifferent to",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4676,"what he might think, evidently determined on some purpose of their own",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4677,"regarding him, and apparently well able to enforce their purpose.",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4678,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4679,We all thought hard just then. It had not seemed wise to object to going,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4680,"with them, even if we could have; our one chance was friendliness--a",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4681,civilized attitude on both sides.,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4682,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4683,"But once inside that building, there was no knowing what these",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4684,determined ladies might do to us. Even a peaceful detention was not to,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4685,"our minds, and when we named it imprisonment it looked even worse.",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4686,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4687,"So we made a stand, trying to make clear that we preferred the open",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4688,"country. One of them came forward with a sketch of our flier, asking by",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4689,signs if we were the aerial visitors they had seen.,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4690,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4691,This we admitted.,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4692,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4693,"They pointed to it again, and to the outlying country, in different",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4694,"directions--but we pretended we did not know where it was, and in",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4695,truth we were not quite sure and gave a rather wild indication of its,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4696,whereabouts.,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4697,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4698,"Again they motioned us to advance, standing so packed about the door",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4699,that there remained but the one straight path open. All around us and,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4700,behind they were massed solidly--there was simply nothing to do but go,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4701,forward--or fight.,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4702,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4703,We held a consultation.,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4704,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4705,"""I never fought with women in my life,"" said Terry, greatly perturbed,",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4706,"""but I'm not going in there. I'm not going to be--herded in--as if we",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4707,"were in a cattle chute.""",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4708,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4709,"""We can't fight them, of course,"" Jeff urged. ""They're all women,",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4710,"in spite of their nondescript clothes; nice women, too; good strong",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4711,"sensible faces. I guess we'll have to go in.""",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4712,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4713,"""We may never get out, if we do,"" I told them. ""Strong and sensible,",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4714,"yes; but I'm not so sure about the good. Look at those faces!""",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4715,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4716,"They had stood at ease, waiting while we conferred together, but never",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4717,relaxing their close attention.,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4718,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4719,Their attitude was not the rigid discipline of soldiers; there was no,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4720,"sense of compulsion about them. Terry's term of a ""vigilance committee""",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4721,"was highly descriptive. They had just the aspect of sturdy burghers,",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4722,"gathered hastily to meet some common need or peril, all moved by",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4723,"precisely the same feelings, to the same end.",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4724,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4725,"Never, anywhere before, had I seen women of precisely this quality.",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4726,"Fishwives and market women might show similar strength, but it was",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4727,coarse and heavy. These were merely athletic--light and powerful.,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4728,"College professors, teachers, writers--many women showed similar",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4729,"intelligence but often wore a strained nervous look, while these were as",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4730,"calm as cows, for all their evident intellect.",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4731,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4732,"We observed pretty closely just then, for all of us felt that it was a",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4733,crucial moment.,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4734,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4735,"The leader gave some word of command and beckoned us on, and the",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4736,surrounding mass moved a step nearer.,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4737,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4738,"""We've got to decide quick,"" said Terry.",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4739,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4740,"""I vote to go in,"" Jeff urged. But we were two to one against him and he",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4741,"loyally stood by us. We made one more effort to be let go, urgent, but",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4742,not imploring. In vain.,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4743,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4744,"""Now for a rush, boys!"" Terry said. ""And if we can't break 'em, I'll",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4745,"shoot in the air.""",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4746,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4747,Then we found ourselves much in the position of the suffragette trying,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4748,to get to the Parliament buildings through a triple cordon of London,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4749,police.,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4750,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4751,The solidity of those women was something amazing. Terry soon found that,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4752,"it was useless, tore himself loose for a moment, pulled his revolver,",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4753,"and fired upward. As they caught at it, he fired again--we heard a",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4754,cry--.,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4755,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4756,"Instantly each of us was seized by five women, each holding arm or leg",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4757,"or head; we were lifted like children, straddling helpless children, and",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4758,"borne onward, wriggling indeed, but most ineffectually.",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4759,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4760,"We were borne inside, struggling manfully, but held secure most",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4761,"womanfully, in spite of our best endeavors.",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4762,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4763,"So carried and so held, we came into a high inner hall, gray and bare,",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4764,and were brought before a majestic gray-haired woman who seemed to hold,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4765,a judicial position.,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4766,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4767,"There was some talk, not much, among them, and then suddenly there fell",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4768,upon each of us at once a firm hand holding a wetted cloth before mouth,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4769,and nose--an order of swimming sweetness--anesthesia.,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"

4774,CHAPTER 3. A Peculiar Imprisonment,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4775,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4776,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4777,"From a slumber as deep as death, as refreshing as that of a healthy",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4778,"child, I slowly awakened.",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4779,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4780,"It was like rising up, up, up through a deep warm ocean, nearer",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4781,and nearer to full light and stirring air. Or like the return to,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4782,consciousness after concussion of the brain. I was once thrown from a,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4783,"horse while on a visit to a wild mountainous country quite new to me,",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4784,"and I can clearly remember the mental experience of coming back to life,",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4785,through lifting veils of dream. When I first dimly heard the voices of,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4786,"those about me, and saw the shining snowpeaks of that mighty range, I",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4787,"assumed that this too would pass, and I should presently find myself in",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4788,my own home.,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4789,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4790,That was precisely the experience of this awakening: receding waves of,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4791,"half-caught swirling vision, memories of home, the steamer, the boat,",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4792,"the airship, the forest--at last all sinking away one after another,",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4793,"till my eyes were wide open, my brain clear, and I realized what had",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4794,happened.,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4795,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4796,The most prominent sensation was of absolute physical comfort. I was,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4797,"lying in a perfect bed: long, broad, smooth; firmly soft and level; with",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4798,"the finest linen, some warm light quilt of blanket, and a counterpane",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4799,"that was a joy to the eye. The sheet turned down some fifteen inches,",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4800,yet I could stretch my feet at the foot of the bed free but warmly,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4801,covered.,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4802,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4803,I felt as light and clean as a white feather. It took me some time to,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4804,"conscientiously locate my arms and legs, to feel the vivid sense of life",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4805,radiate from the wakening center to the extremities.,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4806,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4807,"A big room, high and wide, with many lofty windows whose closed blinds",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4808,"let through soft green-lit air; a beautiful room, in proportion, in",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4809,"color, in smooth simplicity; a scent of blossoming gardens outside.",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4810,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4811,"I lay perfectly still, quite happy, quite conscious, and yet not",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4812,actively realizing what had happened till I heard Terry.,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4813,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4814,"""Gosh!"" was what he said.",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4815,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4816,"I turned my head. There were three beds in this chamber, and plenty of",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4817,room for them.,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4818,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4819,"Terry was sitting up, looking about him, alert as ever. His remark,",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4820,"though not loud, roused Jeff also. We all sat up.",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4821,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4822,"Terry swung his legs out of bed, stood up, stretched himself mightily.",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4823,"He was in a long nightrobe, a sort of seamless garment, undoubtedly",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4824,comfortable--we all found ourselves so covered. Shoes were beside each,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4825,"bed, also quite comfortable and goodlooking though by no means like our",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4826,own.,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4827,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4828,"We looked for our clothes--they were not there, nor anything of all the",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4829,varied contents of our pockets.,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4830,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4831,"A door stood somewhat ajar; it opened into a most attractive bathroom,",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4832,"copiously provided with towels, soap, mirrors, and all such convenient",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4833,"comforts, with indeed our toothbrushes and combs, our notebooks, and",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4834,"thank goodness, our watches--but no clothes.",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4835,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4836,Then we made a search of the big room again and found a large airy,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4837,"closet, holding plenty of clothing, but not ours.",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4838,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4839,"""A council of war!"" demanded Terry. ""Come on back to bed--the bed's all",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4840,"right anyhow. Now then, my scientific friend, let us consider our case",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4841,"dispassionately.""",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4842,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4843,"He meant me, but Jeff seemed most impressed.",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4844,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4845,"""They haven't hurt us in the least!"" he said. ""They could have killed",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4846,"us--or--or anything--and I never felt better in my life.""",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4847,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4848,"""That argues that they are all women,"" I suggested, ""and highly",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4849,civilized. You know you hit one in the last scrimmage--I heard her sing,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4850,"out--and we kicked awfully.""",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4851,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4852,"Terry was grinning at us. ""So you realize what these ladies have done to",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4853,"us?"" he pleasantly inquired. ""They have taken away all our possessions,",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4854,all our clothes--every stitch. We have been stripped and washed and put,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4855,"to bed like so many yearling babies--by these highly civilized women.""",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4856,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4857,Jeff actually blushed. He had a poetic imagination. Terry had,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4858,"imagination enough, of a different kind. So had I, also different.",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4859,"I always flattered myself I had the scientific imagination, which,",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4860,"incidentally, I considered the highest sort. One has a right to a",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4861,certain amount of egotism if founded on fact--and kept to one's self--I,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4862,think.,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4863,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4864,"""No use kicking, boys,"" I said. ""They've got us, and apparently they're",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4865,perfectly harmless. It remains for us to cook up some plan of escape,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4866,like any other bottled heroes. Meanwhile we've got to put on these,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4867,"clothes--Hobson's choice.""",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4868,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4869,"The garments were simple in the extreme, and absolutely comfortable,",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4870,"physically, though of course we all felt like supes in the theater.",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4871,"There was a one-piece cotton undergarment, thin and soft, that reached",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4872,"over the knees and shoulders, something like the one-piece pajamas some",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4873,"fellows wear, and a kind of half-hose, that came up to just under the",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4874,"knee and stayed there--had elastic tops of their own, and covered the",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4875,edges of the first.,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4876,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4877,"Then there was a thicker variety of union suit, a lot of them in the",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4878,"closet, of varying weights and somewhat sturdier material--evidently",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4879,"they would do at a pinch with nothing further. Then there were tunics,",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4880,"knee-length, and some long robes. Needless to say, we took tunics.",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4881,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4882,We bathed and dressed quite cheerfully.,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4883,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4884,"""Not half bad,"" said Terry, surveying himself in a long mirror. His",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4885,"hair was somewhat longer than when we left the last barber, and the",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4886,"hats provided were much like those seen on the prince in the fairy tale,",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4887,lacking the plume.,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4888,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4889,"The costume was similar to that which we had seen on all the women,",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4890,"though some of them, those working in the fields, glimpsed by our",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4891,"glasses when we first flew over, wore only the first two.",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4892,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4893,"I settled my shoulders and stretched my arms, remarking: ""They have",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4894,"worked out a mighty sensible dress, I'll say that for them."" With which",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4895,we all agreed.,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4896,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4897,"""Now then,"" Terry proclaimed, ""we've had a fine long sleep--we've had a",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4898,"good bath--we're clothed and in our right minds, though feeling like a",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4899,lot of neuters. Do you think these highly civilized ladies are going to,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4900,"give us any breakfast?""",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4901,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4902,"""Of course they will,"" Jeff asserted confidently. ""If they had meant to",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4903,"kill us, they would have done it before. I believe we are going to be",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4904,"treated as guests.""",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4905,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4906,"""Hailed as deliverers, I think,"" said Terry.",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4907,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4908,"""Studied as curiosities,"" I told them. ""But anyhow, we want food. So now",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4909,"for a sortie!""",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4910,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4911,A sortie was not so easy.,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4912,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4913,"The bathroom only opened into our chamber, and that had but one outlet,",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4914,"a big heavy door, which was fastened.",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4915,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4916,We listened.,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4917,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4918,"""There's someone outside,"" Jeff suggested. ""Let's knock.""",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4919,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4920,"So we knocked, whereupon the door opened.",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4921,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4922,"Outside was another large room, furnished with a great table at one",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4923,"end, long benches or couches against the wall, some smaller tables",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4924,"and chairs. All these were solid, strong, simple in structure, and",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4925,"comfortable in use--also, incidentally, beautiful.",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4926,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4927,"This room was occupied by a number of women, eighteen to be exact, some",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4928,of whom we distinctly recalled.,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4929,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4930,"Terry heaved a disappointed sigh. ""The Colonels!"" I heard him whisper to",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4931,Jeff.,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4932,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4933,"Jeff, however, advanced and bowed in his best manner; so did we all, and",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4934,we were saluted civilly by the tall-standing women.,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4935,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4936,We had no need to make pathetic pantomime of hunger; the smaller tables,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4937,"were already laid with food, and we were gravely invited to be seated.",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4938,The tables were set for two; each of us found ourselves placed vis-a-vis,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4939,"with one of our hosts, and each table had five other stalwarts nearby,",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4940,unobtrusively watching. We had plenty of time to get tired of those,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4941,women!,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4942,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4943,"The breakfast was not profuse, but sufficient in amount and excellent in",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4944,"quality. We were all too good travelers to object to novelty, and this",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4945,"repast with its new but delicious fruit, its dish of large rich-flavored",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4946,"nuts, and its highly satisfactory little cakes was most agreeable. There",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4947,"was water to drink, and a hot beverage of a most pleasing quality, some",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4948,preparation like cocoa.,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4949,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4950,"And then and there, willy-nilly, before we had satisfied our appetites,",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4951,our education began.,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4952,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4953,"By each of our plates lay a little book, a real printed book, though",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4954,"different from ours both in paper and binding, as well, of course, as in",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4955,type. We examined them curiously.,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4956,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4957,"""Shades of Sauveur!"" muttered Terry. ""We're to learn the language!""",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4958,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4959,"We were indeed to learn the language, and not only that, but to teach",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4960,"our own. There were blank books with parallel columns, neatly ruled,",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4961,"evidently prepared for the occasion, and in these, as fast as we learned",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4962,"and wrote down the name of anything, we were urged to write our own name",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4963,for it by its side.,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4964,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4965,"The book we had to study was evidently a schoolbook, one in which",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4966,"children learned to read, and we judged from this, and from their",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4967,"frequent consultation as to methods, that they had had no previous",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4968,"experience in the art of teaching foreigners their language, or of",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4969,learning any other.,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4970,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4971,"On the other hand, what they lacked in experience, they made up for",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4972,"in genius. Such subtle understanding, such instant recognition of our",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4973,"difficulties, and readiness to meet them, were a constant surprise to",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4974,us.,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4975,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4976,"Of course, we were willing to meet them halfway. It was wholly to",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4977,"our advantage to be able to understand and speak with them, and as",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4978,to refusing to teach them--why should we? Later on we did try open,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4979,"rebellion, but only once.",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4980,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4981,"That first meal was pleasant enough, each of us quietly studying",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4982,"his companion, Jeff with sincere admiration, Terry with that highly",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4983,"technical look of his, as of a past master--like a lion tamer, a serpent",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4984,"charmer, or some such professional. I myself was intensely interested.",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4985,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4986,It was evident that those sets of five were there to check any outbreak,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4987,"on our part. We had no weapons, and if we did try to do any damage, with",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4988,"a chair, say, why five to one was too many for us, even if they were",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4989,"women; that we had found out to our sorrow. It was not pleasant, having",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4990,"them always around, but we soon got used to it.",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4991,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4992,"""It's better than being physically restrained ourselves,"" Jeff",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4993,"philosophically suggested when we were alone. ""They've given us a",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4994,room--with no great possibility of escape--and personal liberty--heavily,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4995,chaperoned. It's better than we'd have been likely to get in a,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4996,"man-country.""",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4997,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4998,"""Man-Country! Do you really believe there are no men here, you innocent?",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
4999,"Don't you know there must be?"" demanded Terry.",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5000,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5001,"""Ye--es,"" Jeff agreed. ""Of course--and yet--""",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5002,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5003,"""And yet--what! Come, you obdurate sentimentalist--what are you thinking",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5004,"about?""",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5005,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5006,"""They may have some peculiar division of labor we've never heard of,"" I",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5007,"suggested. ""The men may live in separate towns, or they may have subdued",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5008,"them--somehow--and keep them shut up. But there must be some.""",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5009,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5010,"""That last suggestion of yours is a nice one, Van,"" Terry protested.",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5011,"""Same as they've got us subdued and shut up! you make me shiver.""",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5012,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5013,"""Well, figure it out for yourself, anyway you please. We saw plenty of",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5014,"kids, the first day, and we've seen those girls--""",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5015,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5016,"""Real girls!"" Terry agreed, in immense relief. ""Glad you mentioned",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5017,"'em. I declare, if I thought there was nothing in the country but those",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5018,"grenadiers I'd jump out the window.""",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5019,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5020,"""Speaking of windows,"" I suggested, ""let's examine ours.""",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5021,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5022,"We looked out of all the windows. The blinds opened easily enough, and",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5023,"there were no bars, but the prospect was not reassuring.",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5024,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5025,This was not the pink-walled town we had so rashly entered the day,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5026,"before. Our chamber was high up, in a projecting wing of a sort of",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5027,"castle, built out on a steep spur of rock. Immediately below us were",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5028,"gardens, fruitful and fragrant, but their high walls followed the edge",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5029,"of the cliff which dropped sheer down, we could not see how far. The",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5030,distant sound of water suggested a river at the foot.,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5031,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5032,"We could look out east, west, and south. To the southeastward stretched",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5033,"the open country, lying bright and fair in the morning light, but on",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5034,"either side, and evidently behind, rose great mountains.",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5035,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5036,"""This thing is a regular fortress--and no women built it, I can tell",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5037,"you that,"" said Terry. We nodded agreeingly. ""It's right up among the",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5038,"hills--they must have brought us a long way.""",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5039,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5040,"""We saw some kind of swift-moving vehicles the first day,"" Jeff reminded",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5041,"us. ""If they've got motors, they ARE civilized.""",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5042,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5043,"""Civilized or not, we've got our work cut out for us to get away from",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5044,here. I don't propose to make a rope of bedclothes and try those walls,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5045,"till I'm sure there is no better way.""",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5046,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5047,"We all concurred on this point, and returned to our discussion as to the",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5048,women.,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5049,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5050,"Jeff continued thoughtful. ""All the same, there's something funny about",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5051,"it,"" he urged. ""It isn't just that we don't see any men--but we don't",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5052,see any signs of them. The--the--reaction of these women is different,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5053,"from any that I've ever met.""",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5054,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5055,"""There is something in what you say, Jeff,"" I agreed. ""There is a",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5056,"different--atmosphere.""",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5057,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5058,"""They don't seem to notice our being men,"" he went on. ""They treat",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5059,us--well--just as they do one another. It's as if our being men was a,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5060,"minor incident.""",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5061,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5062,I nodded. I'd noticed it myself. But Terry broke in rudely.,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5063,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5064,"""Fiddlesticks!"" he said. ""It's because of their advanced age. They're",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5065,"all grandmas, I tell you--or ought to be. Great aunts, anyhow. Those",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5066,"girls were girls all right, weren't they?""",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5067,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5068,"""Yes--"" Jeff agreed, still slowly. ""But they weren't afraid--they flew",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5069,"up that tree and hid, like schoolboys caught out of bounds--not like shy",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5070,"girls.""",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5071,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5072,"""And they ran like marathon winners--you'll admit that, Terry,"" he",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5073,added.,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5074,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5075,Terry was moody as the days passed. He seemed to mind our confinement,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5076,"more than Jeff or I did; and he harped on Alima, and how near he'd come",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5077,"to catching her. ""If I had--"" he would say, rather savagely, ""we'd have",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5078,"had a hostage and could have made terms.""",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5079,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5080,"But Jeff was getting on excellent terms with his tutor, and even his",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5081,"guards, and so was I. It interested me profoundly to note and study",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5082,"the subtle difference between these women and other women, and try to",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5083,"account for them. In the matter of personal appearance, there was a",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5084,"great difference. They all wore short hair, some few inches at most;",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5085,"some curly, some not; all light and clean and fresh-looking.",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5086,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5087,"""If their hair was only long,"" Jeff would complain, ""they would look so",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5088,"much more feminine.""",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5089,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5090,"I rather liked it myself, after I got used to it. Why we should so",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5091,"admire ""a woman's crown of hair"" and not admire a Chinaman's queue is",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5092,"hard to explain, except that we are so convinced that the long hair",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5093,"""belongs"" to a woman. Whereas the ""mane"" in horses is on both, and in",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5094,"lions, buffalos, and such creatures only on the male. But I did miss",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5095,it--at first.,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5096,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5097,Our time was quite pleasantly filled. We were free of the garden below,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5098,"our windows, quite long in its irregular rambling shape, bordering the",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5099,"cliff. The walls were perfectly smooth and high, ending in the masonry",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5100,of the building; and as I studied the great stones I became convinced,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5101,that the whole structure was extremely old. It was built like the,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5102,"pre-Incan architecture in Peru, of enormous monoliths, fitted as closely",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5103,as mosaics.,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5104,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5105,"""These folks have a history, that's sure,"" I told the others. ""And SOME",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5106,"time they were fighters--else why a fortress?""",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5107,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5108,"I said we were free of the garden, but not wholly alone in it. There",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5109,"was always a string of those uncomfortably strong women sitting about,",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5110,"always one of them watching us even if the others were reading, playing",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5111,"games, or busy at some kind of handiwork.",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5112,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5113,"""When I see them knit,"" Terry said, ""I can almost call them feminine.""",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5114,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5115,"""That doesn't prove anything,"" Jeff promptly replied. ""Scotch shepherds",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5116,"knit--always knitting.""",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5117,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5118,"""When we get out--"" Terry stretched himself and looked at the far",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5119,"peaks, ""when we get out of this and get to where the real women are--the",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5120,"mothers, and the girls--""",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5121,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5122,"""Well, what'll we do then?"" I asked, rather gloomily. ""How do you know",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5123,"we'll ever get out?""",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5124,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5125,"This was an unpleasant idea, which we unanimously considered, returning",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5126,with earnestness to our studies.,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5127,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5128,"""If we are good boys and learn our lessons well,"" I suggested. ""If we",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5129,are quiet and respectful and polite and they are not afraid of us--then,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5130,"perhaps they will let us out. And anyway--when we do escape, it is of",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5131,"immense importance that we know the language.""",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5132,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5133,"Personally, I was tremendously interested in that language, and seeing",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5134,"they had books, was eager to get at them, to dig into their history, if",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5135,they had one.,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5136,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5137,"It was not hard to speak, smooth and pleasant to the ear, and so easy",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5138,to read and write that I marveled at it. They had an absolutely phonetic,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5139,"system, the whole thing was as scientific as Esparanto yet bore all the",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5140,marks of an old and rich civilization.,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5141,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5142,"We were free to study as much as we wished, and were not left merely to",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5143,"wander in the garden for recreation but introduced to a great gymnasium,",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5144,partly on the roof and partly in the story below. Here we learned real,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5145,respect for our tall guards. No change of costume was needed for this,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5146,"work, save to lay off outer clothing. The first one was as perfect a",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5147,"garment for exercise as need be devised, absolutely free to move in,",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5148,"and, I had to admit, much better-looking than our usual one.",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5149,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5150,"""Forty--over forty--some of 'em fifty, I bet--and look at 'em!"" grumbled",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5151,Terry in reluctant admiration.,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5152,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5153,"There were no spectacular acrobatics, such as only the young can",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5154,"perform, but for all-around development they had a most excellent",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5155,"system. A good deal of music went with it, with posture dancing and,",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5156,"sometimes, gravely beautiful processional performances.",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5157,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5158,Jeff was much impressed by it. We did not know then how small a part of,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5159,"their physical culture methods this really was, but found it agreeable",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5160,"to watch, and to take part in.",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5161,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5162,"Oh yes, we took part all right! It wasn't absolutely compulsory, but we",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5163,thought it better to please.,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5164,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5165,"Terry was the strongest of us, though I was wiry and had good staying",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5166,"power, and Jeff was a great sprinter and hurdler, but I can tell you",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5167,"those old ladies gave us cards and spades. They ran like deer, by which",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5168,"I mean that they ran not as if it was a performance, but as if it was",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5169,their natural gait. We remembered those fleeting girls of our first,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5170,"bright adventure, and concluded that it was.",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5171,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5172,"They leaped like deer, too, with a quick folding motion of the legs,",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5173,drawn up and turned to one side with a sidelong twist of the body. I,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5174,remembered the sprawling spread-eagle way in which some of the fellows,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5175,used to come over the line--and tried to learn the trick. We did not,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5176,"easily catch up with these experts, however.",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5177,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5178,"""Never thought I'd live to be bossed by a lot of elderly lady acrobats,""",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5179,Terry protested.,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5180,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5181,"They had games, too, a good many of them, but we found them rather",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5182,uninteresting at first. It was like two people playing solitaire to,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5183,see who would get it first; more like a race or a--a competitive,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5184,"examination, than a real game with some fight in it.",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5185,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5186,I philosophized a bit over this and told Terry it argued against their,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5187,"having any men about. ""There isn't a man-size game in the lot,"" I said.",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5188,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"

5194,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5195,"But we could not get out, and we were being educated swiftly. Our",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"

5204,"is limited as yet.""",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5205,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5206,There were many things we meant to ask--as soon as we could talk well,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5207,enough. Better teaching I never saw. From morning to night there was,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5208,"Somel, always on call except between two and four; always pleasant with",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5209,a steady friendly kindness that I grew to enjoy very much. Jeff said,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5210,"Miss Zava--he would put on a title, though they apparently had none--was",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5211,"a darling, that she reminded him of his Aunt Esther at home; but Terry",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5212,"refused to be won, and rather jeered at his own companion, when we were",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5213,alone.,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5214,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5215,"""I'm sick of it!"" he protested. ""Sick of the whole thing. Here we are",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5216,"cooped up as helpless as a bunch of three-year-old orphans, and being",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5217,taught what they think is necessary--whether we like it or not. Confound,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5218,"their old-maid impudence!""",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5219,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5220,Nevertheless we were taught. They brought in a raised map of their,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5221,"country, beautifully made, and increased our knowledge of geographical",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5222,"terms; but when we inquired for information as to the country outside,",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5223,they smilingly shook their heads.,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5224,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5225,"They brought pictures, not only the engravings in the books but colored",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5226,studies of plants and trees and flowers and birds. They brought tools,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5227,"and various small objects--we had plenty of ""material"" in our school.",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5228,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5229,"If it had not been for Terry we would have been much more contented, but",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5230,as the weeks ran into months he grew more and more irritable.,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5231,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5232,"""Don't act like a bear with a sore head,"" I begged him. ""We're getting",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5233,"on finely. Every day we can understand them better, and pretty soon we",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5234,"can make a reasonable plea to be let out--""",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5235,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5236,"""LET out!"" he stormed. ""LET out--like children kept after school. I want",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5237,"to Get Out, and I'm going to. I want to find the men of this place and",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5238,"fight!--or the girls--""",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5239,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5240,"""Guess it's the girls you're most interested in,"" Jeff commented. ""What",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5241,"are you going to fight WITH--your fists?""",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5242,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5243,"""Yes--or sticks and stones--I'd just like to!"" And Terry squared off and",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5244,"tapped Jeff softly on the jaw. ""Just for instance,"" he said.",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5245,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5246,"""Anyhow,"" he went on, ""we could get back to our machine and clear out.""",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5247,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5248,"""If it's there,"" I cautiously suggested.",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5249,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5250,"""Oh, don't croak, Van! If it isn't there, we'll find our way down",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5251,"somehow--the boat's there, I guess.""",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5252,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5253,"It was hard on Terry, so hard that he finally persuaded us to consider",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5254,"a plan of escape. It was difficult, it was highly dangerous, but he",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5255,"declared that he'd go alone if we wouldn't go with him, and of course we",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5256,couldn't think of that.,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5257,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5258,It appeared he had made a pretty careful study of the environment. From,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5259,our end window that faced the point of the promontory we could get a,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5260,"fair idea of the stretch of wall, and the drop below. Also from the roof",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5261,"we could make out more, and even, in one place, glimpse a sort of path",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5262,below the wall.,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5263,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5264,"""It's a question of three things,"" he said. ""Ropes, agility, and not",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5265,"being seen.""",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5266,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5267,"""That's the hardest part,"" I urged, still hoping to dissuade him. ""One",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5268,"or another pair of eyes is on us every minute except at night.""",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5269,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5270,"""Therefore we must do it at night,"" he answered. ""That's easy.""",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5271,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5272,"""We've got to think that if they catch us we may not be so well treated",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5273,"afterward,"" said Jeff.",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5274,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5275,"""That's the business risk we must take. I'm going--if I break my neck.""",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5276,There was no changing him.,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5277,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5278,The rope problem was not easy. Something strong enough to hold a man and,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5279,"long enough to let us down into the garden, and then down over the wall.",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5280,There were plenty of strong ropes in the gymnasium--they seemed to love,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5281,to swing and climb on them--but we were never there by ourselves.,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5282,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5283,"We should have to piece it out from our bedding, rugs, and garments, and",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5284,"moreover, we should have to do it after we were shut in for the",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5285,"night, for every day the place was cleaned to perfection by two of our",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5286,guardians.,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5287,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5288,"We had no shears, no knives, but Terry was resourceful. ""These Jennies",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5289,"have glass and china, you see. We'll break a glass from the bathroom and",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5290,"use that. 'Love will find out a way,'"" he hummed. ""When we're all out of",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5291,"the window, we'll stand three-man high and cut the rope as far up as we",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5292,"can reach, so as to have more for the wall. I know just where I saw",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5293,"that bit of path below, and there's a big tree there, too, or a vine or",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5294,"something--I saw the leaves.""",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5295,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5296,"It seemed a crazy risk to take, but this was, in a way, Terry's",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5297,"expedition, and we were all tired of our imprisonment.",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5298,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5299,"So we waited for full moon, retired early, and spent an anxious hour or",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5300,two in the unskilled manufacture of man-strong ropes.,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5301,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5302,"To retire into the depths of the closet, muffle a glass in thick cloth,",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5303,"and break it without noise was not difficult, and broken glass will cut,",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5304,though not as deftly as a pair of scissors.,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5305,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5306,The broad moonlight streamed in through four of our windows--we had not,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5307,dared leave our lights on too long--and we worked hard and fast at our,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5308,task of destruction.,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5309,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5310,"Hangings, rugs, robes, towels, as well as bed-furniture--even the",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5311,"mattress covers--we left not one stitch upon another, as Jeff put it.",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5312,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5313,"Then at an end window, as less liable to observation, we fastened one",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5314,"end of our cable, strongly, to the firm-set hinge of the inner blind,",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5315,and dropped our coiled bundle of rope softly over.,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5316,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5317,"""This part's easy enough--I'll come last, so as to cut the rope,"" said",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5318,Terry.,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5319,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5320,"So I slipped down first, and stood, well braced against the wall; then",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5321,"Jeff on my shoulders, then Terry, who shook us a little as he sawed",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5322,"through the cord above his head. Then I slowly dropped to the ground,",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5323,"Jeff following, and at last we all three stood safe in the garden, with",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5324,most of our rope with us.,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5325,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5326,"""Good-bye, Grandma!"" whispered Terry, under his breath, and we crept",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5327,"softly toward the wall, taking advantage of the shadow of every bush",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5328,"and tree. He had been foresighted enough to mark the very spot, only a",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5329,"scratch of stone on stone, but we could see to read in that light. For",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5330,"anchorage there was a tough, fair-sized shrub close to the wall.",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5331,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5332,"""Now I'll climb up on you two again and go over first,"" said Terry.",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5333,"""That'll hold the rope firm till you both get up on top. Then I'll go",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5334,"down to the end. If I can get off safely, you can see me and follow--or,",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5335,"say, I'll twitch it three times. If I find there's absolutely no",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5336,"footing--why I'll climb up again, that's all. I don't think they'll kill",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5337,"us.""",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5338,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5339,"From the top he reconnoitered carefully, waved his hand, and whispered,",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5340,"""OK,"" then slipped over. Jeff climbed up and I followed, and we rather",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5341,"shivered to see how far down that swaying, wavering figure dropped, hand",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5342,"under hand, till it disappeared in a mass of foliage far below.",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5343,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5344,"Then there were three quick pulls, and Jeff and I, not without a joyous",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5345,"sense of recovered freedom, successfully followed our leader.",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"

5350,CHAPTER 4. Our Venture,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5351,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5352,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5353,"We were standing on a narrow, irregular, all too slanting little ledge,",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5354,and should doubtless have ignominiously slipped off and broken our rash,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5355,"necks but for the vine. This was a thick-leaved, wide-spreading thing, a",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5356,little like Amphelopsis.,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5357,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5358,"""It's not QUITE vertical here, you see,"" said Terry, full of pride and",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5359,"enthusiasm. ""This thing never would hold our direct weight, but I think",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5360,"if we sort of slide down on it, one at a time, sticking in with hands",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5361,"and feet, we'll reach that next ledge alive.""",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5362,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5363,"""As we do not wish to get up our rope again--and can't comfortably stay",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5364,"here--I approve,"" said Jeff solemnly.",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5365,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5366,Terry slid down first--said he'd show us how a Christian meets,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5367,his death. Luck was with us. We had put on the thickest of those,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5368,"intermediate suits, leaving our tunics behind, and made this scramble",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5369,"quite successfully, though I got a pretty heavy fall just at the end,",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5370,and was only kept on the second ledge by main force. The next stage,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5371,"was down a sort of ""chimney""--a long irregular fissure; and so with",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5372,"scratches many and painful and bruises not a few, we finally reached the",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5373,stream.,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5374,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5375,"It was darker there, but we felt it highly necessary to put as much",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5376,"distance as possible behind us; so we waded, jumped, and clambered down",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5377,"that rocky riverbed, in the flickering black and white moonlight and",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5378,"leaf shadow, till growing daylight forced a halt.",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5379,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5380,"We found a friendly nut-tree, those large, satisfying, soft-shelled nuts",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5381,"we already knew so well, and filled our pockets.",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5382,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5383,I see that I have not remarked that these women had pockets in,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5384,"surprising number and variety. They were in all their garments, and the",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5385,middle one in particular was shingled with them. So we stocked up with,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5386,"nuts till we bulged like Prussian privates in marching order, drank all",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5387,"we could hold, and retired for the day.",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5388,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5389,"It was not a very comfortable place, not at all easy to get at, just",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5390,"a sort of crevice high up along the steep bank, but it was well veiled",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5391,with foliage and dry. After our exhaustive three- or four-hour scramble,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5392,"and the good breakfast food, we all lay down along that crack--heads and",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5393,"tails, as it were--and slept till the afternoon sun almost toasted our",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5394,faces.,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5395,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5396,Terry poked a tentative foot against my head.,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5397,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5398,"""How are you, Van? Alive yet?""",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5399,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5400,"""Very much so,"" I told him. And Jeff was equally cheerful.",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5401,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5402,"We had room to stretch, if not to turn around; but we could very",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5403,"carefully roll over, one at a time, behind the sheltering foliage.",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5404,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5405,It was no use to leave there by daylight. We could not see much of the,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5406,"country, but enough to know that we were now at the beginning of the",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5407,"cultivated area, and no doubt there would be an alarm sent out far and",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5408,wide.,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5409,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5410,"Terry chuckled softly to himself, lying there on that hot narrow little",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5411,"rim of rock. He dilated on the discomfiture of our guards and tutors,",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5412,making many discourteous remarks.,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5413,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5414,I reminded him that we had still a long way to go before getting to,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5415,"the place where we'd left our machine, and no probability of finding it",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5416,"there; but he only kicked me, mildly, for a croaker.",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5417,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5418,"""If you can't boost, don't knock,"" he protested. ""I never said 'twould",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5419,be a picnic. But I'd run away in the Antarctic ice fields rather than be,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5420,"a prisoner.""",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5421,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5422,We soon dozed off again.,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5423,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5424,"The long rest and penetrating dry heat were good for us, and that night",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5425,"we covered a considerable distance, keeping always in the rough forested",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5426,belt of land which we knew bordered the whole country. Sometimes we were,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5427,"near the outer edge, and caught sudden glimpses of the tremendous depths",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5428,beyond.,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5429,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5430,"""This piece of geography stands up like a basalt column,"" Jeff said.",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5431,"""Nice time we'll have getting down if they have confiscated our",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5432,"machine!"" For which suggestion he received summary chastisement.",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5433,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5434,"What we could see inland was peaceable enough, but only moonlit",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5435,"glimpses; by daylight we lay very close. As Terry said, we did not wish",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5436,to kill the old ladies--even if we could; and short of that they,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5437,"were perfectly competent to pick us up bodily and carry us back, if",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5438,"discovered. There was nothing for it but to lie low, and sneak out",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5439,unseen if we could do it.,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5440,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5441,There wasn't much talking done. At night we had our marathon-obstacle,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5442,"race; we ""stayed not for brake and we stopped not for stone,"" and swam",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5443,whatever water was too deep to wade and could not be got around; but,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5444,"that was only necessary twice. By day, sleep, sound and sweet. Mighty",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5445,lucky it was that we could live off the country as we did. Even that,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5446,margin of forest seemed rich in foodstuffs.,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5447,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5448,But Jeff thoughtfully suggested that that very thing showed how careful,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5449,"we should have to be, as we might run into some stalwart group of",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5450,"gardeners or foresters or nut-gatherers at any minute. Careful we were,",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5451,feeling pretty sure that if we did not make good this time we were not,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5452,likely to have another opportunity; and at last we reached a point from,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5453,"which we could see, far below, the broad stretch of that still lake from",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5454,which we had made our ascent.,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5455,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5456,"""That looks pretty good to me!"" said Terry, gazing down at it. ""Now, if",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5457,"we can't find the 'plane, we know where to aim if we have to drop over",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5458,"this wall some other way.""",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5459,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5460,The wall at that point was singularly uninviting. It rose so straight,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5461,"that we had to put our heads over to see the base, and the country below",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5462,seemed to be a far-off marshy tangle of rank vegetation. We did not have,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5463,"to risk our necks to that extent, however, for at last, stealing along",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5464,"among the rocks and trees like so many creeping savages, we came to that",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5465,"flat space where we had landed; and there, in unbelievable good fortune,",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5466,we found our machine.,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5467,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5468,"""Covered, too, by jingo! Would you think they had that much sense?""",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5469,cried Terry.,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5470,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5471,"""If they had that much, they're likely to have more,"" I warned him,",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5472,"softly. ""Bet you the thing's watched.""",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5473,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5474,We reconnoitered as widely as we could in the failing moonlight--moons,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5475,are of a painfully unreliable nature; but the growing dawn showed us,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5476,"the familiar shape, shrouded in some heavy cloth like canvas, and no",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5477,slightest sign of any watchman near. We decided to make a quick dash as,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5478,soon as the light was strong enough for accurate work.,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5479,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5480,"""I don't care if the old thing'll go or not,"" Terry declared. ""We can",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5481,"run her to the edge, get aboard, and just plane down--plop!--beside our",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5482,"boat there. Look there--see the boat!""",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5483,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5484,"Sure enough--there was our motor, lying like a gray cocoon on the flat",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5485,pale sheet of water.,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5486,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5487,Quietly but swiftly we rushed forward and began to tug at the fastenings,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"

5491,"it sewed up in a bag! And we've not a knife among us!""",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5492,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5493,"Then, as we tugged and pulled at that tough cloth we heard a sound that",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5494,made Terry lift his head like a war horse--the sound of an unmistakable,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5495,"giggle, yes--three giggles.",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5496,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5497,"There they were--Celis, Alima, Ellador--looking just as they had when",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5498,"we first saw them, standing a little way off from us, as interested, as",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5499,mischievous as three schoolboys.,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5500,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5501,"""Hold on, Terry--hold on!"" I warned. ""That's too easy. Look out for a",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5502,"trap.""",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5503,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5504,"""Let us appeal to their kind hearts,"" Jeff urged. ""I think they will",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5505,"help us. Perhaps they've got knives.""",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5506,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5507,"""It's no use rushing them, anyhow,"" I was absolutely holding on to",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5508,"Terry. ""We know they can out-run and out-climb us.""",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5509,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5510,"He reluctantly admitted this; and after a brief parley among ourselves,",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5511,"we all advanced slowly toward them, holding out our hands in token of",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5512,friendliness.,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5513,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5514,"They stood their ground till we had come fairly near, and then indicated",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5515,"that we should stop. To make sure, we advanced a step or two and they",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5516,promptly and swiftly withdrew. So we stopped at the distance specified.,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5517,"Then we used their language, as far as we were able, to explain our",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5518,"plight, telling how we were imprisoned, how we had escaped--a good deal",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5519,of pantomime here and vivid interest on their part--how we had traveled,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5520,"by night and hidden by day, living on nuts--and here Terry pretended",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5521,great hunger.,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5522,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5523,I know he could not have been hungry; we had found plenty to eat and,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5524,had not been sparing in helping ourselves. But they seemed somewhat,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5525,impressed; and after a murmured consultation they produced from their,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5526,"pockets certain little packages, and with the utmost ease and accuracy",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5527,tossed them into our hands.,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5528,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5529,Jeff was most appreciative of this; and Terry made extravagant gestures,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5530,"of admiration, which seemed to set them off, boy-fashion, to show their",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5531,"skill. While we ate the excellent biscuits they had thrown us, and while",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5532,"Ellador kept a watchful eye on our movements, Celis ran off to some",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5533,"distance, and set up a sort of ""duck-on-a-rock"" arrangement, a big",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5534,"yellow nut on top of three balanced sticks; Alima, meanwhile, gathering",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5535,stones.,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5536,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5537,"They urged us to throw at it, and we did, but the thing was a long way",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5538,"off, and it was only after a number of failures, at which those elvish",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5539,"damsels laughed delightedly, that Jeff succeeded in bringing the whole",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5540,"structure to the ground. It took me still longer, and Terry, to his",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5541,"intense annoyance, came third.",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5542,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5543,"Then Celis set up the little tripod again, and looked back at us,",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5544,"knocking it down, pointing at it, and shaking her short curls severely.",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5545,"""No,"" she said. ""Bad--wrong!"" We were quite able to follow her.",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5546,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5547,"Then she set it up once more, put the fat nut on top, and returned",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5548,to the others; and there those aggravating girls sat and took turns,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5549,"throwing little stones at that thing, while one stayed by as a",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5550,"setter-up; and they just popped that nut off, two times out of three,",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5551,"without upsetting the sticks. Pleased as Punch they were, too, and we",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5552,"pretended to be, but weren't.",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5553,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5554,"We got very friendly over this game, but I told Terry we'd be sorry if",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5555,"we didn't get off while we could, and then we begged for knives. It was",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5556,"easy to show what we wanted to do, and they each proudly produced a sort",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5557,of strong clasp-knife from their pockets.,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5558,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5559,"""Yes,"" we said eagerly, ""that's it! Please--"" We had learned quite a",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5560,"bit of their language, you see. And we just begged for those knives, but",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5561,they would not give them to us. If we came a step too near they backed,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5562,"off, standing light and eager for flight.",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5563,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5564,"""It's no sort of use,"" I said. ""Come on--let's get a sharp stone or",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5565,"something--we must get this thing off.""",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5566,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5567,"So we hunted about and found what edged fragments we could, and hacked",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5568,"away, but it was like trying to cut sailcloth with a clamshell.",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5569,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5570,"Terry hacked and dug, but said to us under his breath. ""Boys, we're in",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5571,pretty good condition--let's make a life and death dash and get hold of,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5572,"those girls--we've got to.""",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5573,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5574,"They had drawn rather nearer to watch our efforts, and we did take",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5575,"them rather by surprise; also, as Terry said, our recent training had",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5576,"strengthened us in wind and limb, and for a few desperate moments those",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5577,girls were scared and we almost triumphant.,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5578,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5579,"But just as we stretched out our hands, the distance between us widened;",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5580,"they had got their pace apparently, and then, though we ran at our",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5581,"utmost speed, and much farther than I thought wise, they kept just out",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5582,of reach all the time.,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5583,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5584,"We stopped breathless, at last, at my repeated admonitions.",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5585,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5586,"""This is stark foolishness,"" I urged. ""They are doing it on",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5587,"purpose--come back or you'll be sorry.""",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5588,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5589,"We went back, much slower than we came, and in truth we were sorry.",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5590,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5591,"As we reached our swaddled machine, and sought again to tear loose its",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5592,"covering, there rose up from all around the sturdy forms, the quiet",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5593,determined faces we knew so well.,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5594,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5595,"""Oh Lord!"" groaned Terry. ""The Colonels! It's all up--they're forty to",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5596,"one.""",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5597,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5598,"It was no use to fight. These women evidently relied on numbers, not so",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5599,much as a drilled force but as a multitude actuated by a common impulse.,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5600,"They showed no sign of fear, and since we had no weapons whatever and",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5601,"there were at least a hundred of them, standing ten deep about us, we",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5602,gave in as gracefully as we might.,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5603,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5604,"Of course we looked for punishment--a closer imprisonment, solitary",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5605,confinement maybe--but nothing of the kind happened. They treated us as,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5606,"truants only, and as if they quite understood our truancy.",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5607,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5608,"Back we went, not under an anesthetic this time but skimming along in",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5609,"electric motors enough like ours to be quite recognizable, each of us",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5610,in a separate vehicle with one able-bodied lady on either side and three,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5611,facing him.,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5612,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5613,"They were all pleasant enough, and talked to us as much as was possible",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5614,"with our limited powers. And though Terry was keenly mortified, and at",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5615,"first we all rather dreaded harsh treatment, I for one soon began to",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5616,feel a sort of pleasant confidence and to enjoy the trip.,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5617,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5618,"Here were my five familiar companions, all good-natured as could be,",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5619,seeming to have no worse feeling than a mild triumph as of winning some,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5620,simple game; and even that they politely suppressed.,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5621,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5622,"This was a good opportunity to see the country, too, and the more I saw",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5623,"of it, the better I liked it. We went too swiftly for close observation,",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5624,"but I could appreciate perfect roads, as dustless as a swept floor; the",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5625,shade of endless lines of trees; the ribbon of flowers that unrolled,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5626,beneath them; and the rich comfortable country that stretched off and,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5627,"away, full of varied charm.",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5628,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5629,"We rolled through many villages and towns, and I soon saw that the",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5630,parklike beauty of our first-seen city was no exception. Our swift,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5631,"high-sweeping view from the 'plane had been most attractive, but lacked",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5632,"detail; and in that first day of struggle and capture, we noticed",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5633,little. But now we were swept along at an easy rate of some thirty miles,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5634,an hour and covered quite a good deal of ground.,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5635,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5636,"We stopped for lunch in quite a sizable town, and here, rolling slowly",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5637,"through the streets, we saw more of the population. They had come out",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5638,"to look at us everywhere we had passed, but here were more; and when we",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5639,"went in to eat, in a big garden place with little shaded tables among",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5640,"the trees and flowers, many eyes were upon us. And everywhere, open",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5641,"country, village, or city--only women. Old women and young women and a",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5642,"great majority who seemed neither young nor old, but just women; young",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5643,"girls, also, though these, and the children, seeming to be in groups by",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5644,"themselves generally, were less in evidence. We caught many glimpses of",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5645,"girls and children in what seemed to be schools or in playgrounds, and",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5646,"so far as we could judge there were no boys. We all looked, carefully.",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5647,"Everyone gazed at us politely, kindly, and with eager interest. No one",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5648,"was impertinent. We could catch quite a bit of the talk now, and all",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5649,they said seemed pleasant enough.,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5650,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5651,Well--before nightfall we were all safely back in our big room. The,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5652,damage we had done was quite ignored; the beds as smooth and comfortable,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5653,"as before, new clothing and towels supplied. The only thing those women",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5654,"did was to illuminate the gardens at night, and to set an extra watch.",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5655,"But they called us to account next day. Our three tutors, who had not",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5656,"joined in the recapturing expedition, had been quite busy in preparing",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5657,"for us, and now made explanation.",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5658,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5659,"They knew well we would make for our machine, and also that there was no",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5660,other way of getting down--alive. So our flight had troubled no one; all,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5661,they did was to call the inhabitants to keep an eye on our movements all,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5662,along the edge of the forest between the two points. It appeared that,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5663,"many of those nights we had been seen, by careful ladies sitting snugly",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5664,"in big trees by the riverbed, or up among the rocks.",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5665,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5666,"Terry looked immensely disgusted, but it struck me as extremely funny.",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5667,"Here we had been risking our lives, hiding and prowling like outlaws,",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5668,"living on nuts and fruit, getting wet and cold at night, and dry and hot",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5669,"by day, and all the while these estimable women had just been waiting",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5670,for us to come out.,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5671,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5672,"Now they began to explain, carefully using such words as we could",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5673,understand. It appeared that we were considered as guests of the,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5674,country--sort of public wards. Our first violence had made it necessary,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5675,"to keep us safeguarded for a while, but as soon as we learned the",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5676,language--and would agree to do no harm--they would show us all about,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5677,the land.,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5678,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5679,"Jeff was eager to reassure them. Of course he did not tell on Terry, but",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5680,"he made it clear that he was ashamed of himself, and that he would now",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5681,conform. As to the language--we all fell upon it with redoubled energy.,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5682,"They brought us books, in greater numbers, and I began to study them",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5683,seriously.,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5684,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5685,"""Pretty punk literature,"" Terry burst forth one day, when we were in",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5686,"the privacy of our own room. ""Of course one expects to begin on",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5687,"child-stories, but I would like something more interesting now.""",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5688,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5689,"""Can't expect stirring romance and wild adventure without men, can you?""",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5690,I asked. Nothing irritated Terry more than to have us assume that there,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5691,"were no men; but there were no signs of them in the books they gave us,",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5692,or the pictures.,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5693,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5694,"""Shut up!"" he growled. ""What infernal nonsense you talk! I'm going to",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5695,"ask 'em outright--we know enough now.""",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5696,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5697,"In truth we had been using our best efforts to master the language, and",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5698,were able to read fluently and to discuss what we read with considerable,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5699,ease.,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5700,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5701,That afternoon we were all sitting together on the roof--we three and,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5702,"the tutors gathered about a table, no guards about. We had been made to",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5703,understand some time earlier that if we would agree to do no violence,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5704,"they would withdraw their constant attendance, and we promised most",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5705,willingly.,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5706,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5707,"So there we sat, at ease; all in similar dress; our hair, by now, as",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5708,"long as theirs, only our beards to distinguish us. We did not want those",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5709,"beards, but had so far been unable to induce them to give us any cutting",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5710,instruments.,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5711,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5712,"""Ladies,"" Terry began, out of a clear sky, as it were, ""are there no men",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5713,"in this country?""",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5714,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5715,"""Men?"" Somel answered. ""Like you?""",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5716,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5717,"""Yes, men,"" Terry indicated his beard, and threw back his broad",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5718,"shoulders. ""Men, real men.""",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5719,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5720,"""No,"" she answered quietly. ""There are no men in this country. There has",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5721,"not been a man among us for two thousand years.""",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5722,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5723,Her look was clear and truthful and she did not advance this astonishing,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5724,"statement as if it was astonishing, but quite as a matter of fact.",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5725,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5726,"""But--the people--the children,"" he protested, not believing her in the",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5727,"least, but not wishing to say so.",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5728,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5729,"""Oh yes,"" she smiled. ""I do not wonder you are puzzled. We are",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5730,mothers--all of us--but there are no fathers. We thought you would ask,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5731,"about that long ago--why have you not?"" Her look was as frankly kind as",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5732,"always, her tone quite simple.",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5733,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5734,"Terry explained that we had not felt sufficiently used to the language,",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5735,"making rather a mess of it, I thought, but Jeff was franker.",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5736,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5737,"""Will you excuse us all,"" he said, ""if we admit that we find it hard to",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"

5742,"""Why, yes--some low forms, of course.""",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5743,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5744,"""How low--or how high, rather?""",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5745,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5746,"""Well--there are some rather high forms of insect life in which it",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5747,"occurs. Parthenogenesis, we call it--that means virgin birth.""",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"

5753,"Terry looked uncomfortable, but Jeff met the question quite calmly.",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5754,"""Among mating animals, the term VIRGIN is applied to the female who has",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5755,"not mated,"" he answered.",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5756,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5757,"""Oh, I see. And does it apply to the male also? Or is there a different",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5758,"term for him?""",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"

5763,"""No?"" she said. ""But one cannot mate without the other surely. Is not",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"

5765,"life in which there is birth from a father only?""",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5766,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"

5768,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5769,"""You ask us to believe that for two thousand years there have been only",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"

5776,"to speak freely with us, and teach us about your country and the rest of",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5777,"the world. You know so much, you see, and we know only our own land.""",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5778,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5779,In the course of our previous studies we had been at some pains to tell,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"

5781,"globe, even, out of a spherical fruit, and show the size and relation of",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5782,"the countries, and to tell of the numbers of their people. All this had",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5783,"been scant and in outline, but they quite understood.",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5784,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5785,I find I succeed very poorly in conveying the impression I would like to,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5786,"of these women. So far from being ignorant, they were deeply wise--that",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5787,"we realized more and more; and for clear reasoning, for real brain scope",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5788,"and power they were A No. 1, but there were a lot of things they did not",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5789,know.,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5790,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5791,"They had the evenest tempers, the most perfect patience and good",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5792,nature--one of the things most impressive about them all was the absence,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5793,"of irritability. So far we had only this group to study, but afterward I",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5794,found it a common trait.,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5795,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5796,"We had gradually come to feel that we were in the hands of friends, and",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5797,very capable ones at that--but we couldn't form any opinion yet of the,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5798,general level of these women.,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5799,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5800,"""We want you to teach us all you can,"" Somel went on, her firm shapely",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5801,"hands clasped on the table before her, her clear quiet eyes meeting",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5802,"ours frankly. ""And we want to teach you what we have that is novel and",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5803,"useful. You can well imagine that it is a wonderful event to us, to have",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"

5805,"women.""",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5806,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5807,What she said about our importance gave instant pleasure to Terry. I,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5808,could see by the way he lifted his head that it pleased him. But when,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5809,she spoke of our women--someway I had a queer little indescribable,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5810,"feeling, not like any feeling I ever had before when ""women"" were",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5811,mentioned.,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5812,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5813,"""Will you tell us how it came about?"" Jeff pursued. ""You said 'for two",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"

5820,"""You should have our full history to read--do not be alarmed--it has",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"

5823,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"

5830,"see, with our birds, that the father is as useful as the mother, almost.",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5831,"But among insects we find him of less importance, sometimes very little.",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5832,"Is it not so with you?""",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5833,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"

5857,they looked amazed and a shade displeased.,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5858,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5859,"Jeff came to the rescue. ""We keep cattle for their milk, as well as",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"

5861,"There is a great milk industry--to collect and distribute it.""",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5862,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5863,"Still they looked puzzled. I pointed to my outline of a cow. ""The farmer",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5864,"milks the cow,"" I said, and sketched a milk pail, the stool, and in",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5865,"pantomime showed the man milking. ""Then it is carried to the city and",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"

5875,"process which robs the cow of her calf, and the calf of its true food;",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5876,and the talk led us into a further discussion of the meat business. They,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"

5883,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5884,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5885,It is no use for me to try to piece out this account with adventures.,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5886,If the people who read it are not interested in these amazing women and,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5887,"their history, they will not be interested at all.",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5888,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5889,As for us--three young men to a whole landful of women--what could we,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5890,"do? We did get away, as described, and were peacefully brought back",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5891,"again without, as Terry complained, even the satisfaction of hitting",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5892,anybody.,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5893,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5894,There were no adventures because there was nothing to fight. There were,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5895,no wild beasts in the country and very few tame ones. Of these I might,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5896,"as well stop to describe the one common pet of the country. Cats, of",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5897,course. But such cats!,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5898,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5899,What do you suppose these Lady Burbanks had done with their cats? By the,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5900,most prolonged and careful selection and exclusion they had developed a,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5901,race of cats that did not sing! That's a fact. The most those poor dumb,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5902,brutes could do was to make a kind of squeak when they were hungry or,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5903,"wanted the door open, and, of course, to purr, and make the various",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5904,mother-noises to their kittens.,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5905,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5906,"Moreover, they had ceased to kill birds. They were rigorously bred to",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5907,destroy mice and moles and all such enemies of the food supply; but the,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5908,birds were numerous and safe.,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5909,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5910,"While we were discussing birds, Terry asked them if they used feathers",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5911,"for their hats, and they seemed amused at the idea. He made a few",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5912,"sketches of our women's hats, with plumes and quills and those various",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5913,"tickling things that stick out so far; and they were eagerly interested,",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5914,as at everything about our women.,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5915,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5916,"As for them, they said they only wore hats for shade when working in the",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5917,"sun; and those were big light straw hats, something like those used in",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5918,China and Japan. In cold weather they wore caps or hoods.,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5919,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5920,"""But for decorative purposes--don't you think they would be becoming?""",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5921,"pursued Terry, making as pretty a picture as he could of a lady with a",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5922,plumed hat.,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5923,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5924,"They by no means agreed to that, asking quite simply if the men wore the",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5925,same kind. We hastened to assure her that they did not--drew for them,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5926,our kind of headgear.,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5927,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5928,"""And do no men wear feathers in their hats?""",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5929,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5930,"""Only Indians,"" Jeff explained. ""Savages, you know."" And he sketched a",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5931,war bonnet to show them.,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5932,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5933,"""And soldiers,"" I added, drawing a military hat with plumes.",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5934,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5935,"They never expressed horror or disapproval, nor indeed much",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5936,surprise--just a keen interest. And the notes they made!--miles of them!,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5937,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5938,But to return to our pussycats. We were a good deal impressed by this,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5939,"achievement in breeding, and when they questioned us--I can tell you we",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5940,were well pumped for information--we told of what had been done for dogs,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5941,"and horses and cattle, but that there was no effort applied to cats,",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5942,except for show purposes.,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5943,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5944,"I wish I could represent the kind, quiet, steady, ingenious way they",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5945,questioned us. It was not just curiosity--they weren't a bit more,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5946,"curious about us than we were about them, if as much. But they were",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5947,"bent on understanding our kind of civilization, and their lines of",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5948,interrogation would gradually surround us and drive us in till we found,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5949,ourselves up against some admissions we did not want to make.,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5950,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5951,"""Are all these breeds of dogs you have made useful?"" they asked.",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5952,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5953,"""Oh--useful! Why, the hunting dogs and watchdogs and sheepdogs are",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5954,"useful--and sleddogs of course!--and ratters, I suppose, but we don't",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5955,"keep dogs for their USEFULNESS. The dog is 'the friend of man,' we",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5956,"say--we love them.""",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5957,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5958,"That they understood. ""We love our cats that way. They surely are our",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5959,"friends, and helpers, too. You can see how intelligent and affectionate",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5960,"they are.""",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5961,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5962,"It was a fact. I'd never seen such cats, except in a few rare instances.",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5963,"Big, handsome silky things, friendly with everyone and devotedly",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5964,attached to their special owners.,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5965,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5966,"""You must have a heartbreaking time drowning kittens,"" we suggested. But",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5967,"they said, ""Oh, no! You see we care for them as you do for your valuable",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5968,"cattle. The fathers are few compared to the mothers, just a few very",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5969,fine ones in each town; they live quite happily in walled gardens and,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5970,the houses of their friends. But they only have a mating season once a,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5971,"year.""",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5972,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5973,"""Rather hard on Thomas, isn't it?"" suggested Terry.",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5974,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5975,"""Oh, no--truly! You see, it is many centuries that we have been breeding",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5976,"the kind of cats we wanted. They are healthy and happy and friendly, as",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5977,"you see. How do you manage with your dogs? Do you keep them in pairs, or",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5978,"segregate the fathers, or what?""",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5979,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5980,"Then we explained that--well, that it wasn't a question of fathers",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5981,"exactly; that nobody wanted a--a mother dog; that, well, that",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5982,practically all our dogs were males--there was only a very small,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5983,percentage of females allowed to live.,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5984,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5985,"Then Zava, observing Terry with her grave sweet smile, quoted back at",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5986,"him: ""Rather hard on Thomas, isn't it? Do they enjoy it--living without",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"

5988,"cats?""",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5989,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5990,"Jeff laughed, eyeing Terry mischievously. As a matter of fact we began",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5991,to feel Jeff something of a traitor--he so often flopped over and took,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5992,their side of things; also his medical knowledge gave him a different,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5993,point of view somehow.,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5994,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5995,"""I'm sorry to admit,"" he told them, ""that the dog, with us, is the most",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5996,diseased of any animal--next to man. And as to temper--there are always,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5997,"some dogs who bite people--especially children.""",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5998,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
5999,"That was pure malice. You see, children were the--the RAISON D'ETRE in",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
6000,this country. All our interlocutors sat up straight at once. They were,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
6001,"still gentle, still restrained, but there was a note of deep amazement",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
6002,in their voices.,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
6003,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
6004,"""Do we understand that you keep an animal--an unmated male animal--that",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
6005,"bites children? About how many are there of them, please?""",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
6006,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
6007,"""Thousands--in a large city,"" said Jeff, ""and nearly every family has",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
6008,"one in the country.""",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
6009,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
6010,"Terry broke in at this. ""You must not imagine they are all",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
6011,"dangerous--it's not one in a hundred that ever bites anybody. Why, they",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"

6013,"that hasn't a dog to play with!""",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
6014,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
6015,"""And the girls?"" asked Somel.",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
6016,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
6017,"""Oh--girls--why they like them too,"" he said, but his voice flatted a",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
6018,"little. They always noticed little things like that, we found later.",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
6019,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
6020,"Little by little they wrung from us the fact that the friend of man,",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
6021,"in the city, was a prisoner; was taken out for his meager exercise on",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
6022,a leash; was liable not only to many diseases but to the one destroying,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
6023,"horror of rabies; and, in many cases, for the safety of the citizens,",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
6024,had to go muzzled. Jeff maliciously added vivid instances he had known,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
6025,or read of injury and death from mad dogs.,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
6026,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
6027,"They did not scold or fuss about it. Calm as judges, those women were.",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"

6083,description.,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
6084,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
6085,And I'll summarize here a bit as to our opportunities for learning it.,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
6086,"I will not try to repeat the careful, detailed account I lost; I'll just",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
6087,"say that we were kept in that fortress a good six months all told, and",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
6088,"after that, three in a pleasant enough city where--to Terry's infinite",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
6089,"disgust--there were only ""Colonels"" and little children--no young women",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
6090,whatever. Then we were under surveillance for three more--always with a,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
6091,tutor or a guard or both. But those months were pleasant because we were,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
6092,really getting acquainted with the girls. That was a chapter!--or will,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
6093,be--I will try to do justice to it.,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
6094,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
6095,We learned their language pretty thoroughly--had to; and they learned,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
6096,ours much more quickly and used it to hasten our own studies.,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
6097,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
6098,"Jeff, who was never without reading matter of some sort, had two little",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
6099,"books with him, a novel and a little anthology of verse; and I had one",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
6100,"of those pocket encyclopedias--a fat little thing, bursting with facts.",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
6101,These were used in our education--and theirs. Then as soon as we were up,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
6102,"to it, they furnished us with plenty of their own books, and I went in",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
6103,for the history part--I wanted to understand the genesis of this miracle,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
6104,of theirs.,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
6105,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
6106,"And this is what happened, according to their records.",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
6107,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
6108,As to geography--at about the time of the Christian era this land had,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
6109,"a free passage to the sea. I'm not saying where, for good reasons. But",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
6110,"there was a fairly easy pass through that wall of mountains behind us,",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
6111,"and there is no doubt in my mind that these people were of Aryan stock,",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
6112,and were once in contact with the best civilization of the old world.,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
6113,"They were ""white,"" but somewhat darker than our northern races because",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
6114,of their constant exposure to sun and air.,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
6115,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
6116,"The country was far larger then, including much land beyond the pass,",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
6117,"and a strip of coast. They had ships, commerce, an army, a king--for at",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
6118,that time they were what they so calmly called us--a bi-sexual race.,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
6119,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
6120,What happened to them first was merely a succession of historic,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
6121,misfortunes such as have befallen other nations often enough. They,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
6122,"were decimated by war, driven up from their coastline till finally the",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
6123,"reduced population, with many of the men killed in battle, occupied this",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
6124,"hinterland, and defended it for years, in the mountain passes. Where it",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
6125,was open to any possible attack from below they strengthened the natural,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
6126,"defenses so that it became unscalably secure, as we found it.",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
6127,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
6128,"They were a polygamous people, and a slave-holding people, like all of",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
6129,their time; and during the generation or two of this struggle to defend,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
6130,"their mountain home they built the fortresses, such as the one we were",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
6131,"held in, and other of their oldest buildings, some still in use. Nothing",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
6132,"but earthquakes could destroy such architecture--huge solid blocks,",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
6133,holding by their own weight. They must have had efficient workmen and,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
6134,enough of them in those days.,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
6135,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
6136,"They made a brave fight for their existence, but no nation can stand",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
6137,"up against what the steamship companies call ""an act of God."" While",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
6138,the whole fighting force was doing its best to defend their mountain,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
6139,"pathway, there occurred a volcanic outburst, with some local tremors,",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
6140,and the result was the complete filling up of the pass--their only,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
6141,"outlet. Instead of a passage, a new ridge, sheer and high, stood between",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
6142,"them and the sea; they were walled in, and beneath that wall lay their",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
6143,"whole little army. Very few men were left alive, save the slaves;",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
6144,"and these now seized their opportunity, rose in revolt, killed their",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
6145,"remaining masters even to the youngest boy, killed the old women too,",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
6146,"and the mothers, intending to take possession of the country with the",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
6147,remaining young women and girls.,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
6148,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
6149,But this succession of misfortunes was too much for those infuriated,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
6150,"virgins. There were many of them, and but few of these would-be masters,",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
6151,"so the young women, instead of submitting, rose in sheer desperation and",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
6152,slew their brutal conquerors.,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
6153,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
6154,"This sounds like Titus Andronicus, I know, but that is their account. I",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
6155,suppose they were about crazy--can you blame them?,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
6156,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
6157,There was literally no one left on this beautiful high garden land but a,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
6158,bunch of hysterical girls and some older slave women.,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
6159,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
6160,That was about two thousand years ago.,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
6161,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
6162,At first there was a period of sheer despair. The mountains towered,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
6163,"between them and their old enemies, but also between them and escape.",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
6164,There was no way up or down or out--they simply had to stay there. Some,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
6165,"were for suicide, but not the majority. They must have been a plucky",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
6166,"lot, as a whole, and they decided to live--as long as they did live.",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
6167,"Of course they had hope, as youth must, that something would happen to",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
6168,change their fate.,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
6169,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
6170,"So they set to work, to bury the dead, to plow and sow, to care for one",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
6171,another.,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
6172,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
6173,"Speaking of burying the dead, I will set down while I think of it, that",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
6174,"they had adopted cremation in about the thirteenth century, for the same",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
6175,reason that they had left off raising cattle--they could not spare,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
6176,the room. They were much surprised to learn that we were still,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
6177,"burying--asked our reasons for it, and were much dissatisfied with what",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
6178,"we gave. We told them of the belief in the resurrection of the body, and",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
6179,they asked if our God was not as well able to resurrect from ashes as,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
6180,from long corruption. We told them of how people thought it repugnant to,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
6181,"have their loved ones burn, and they asked if it was less repugnant to",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
6182,"have them decay. They were inconveniently reasonable, those women.",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
6183,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
6184,Well--that original bunch of girls set to work to clean up the place and,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
6185,make their living as best they could. Some of the remaining slave women,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
6186,"rendered invaluable service, teaching such trades as they knew. They",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
6187,"had such records as were then kept, all the tools and implements of the",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
6188,"time, and a most fertile land to work in.",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
6189,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
6190,"There were a handful of the younger matrons who had escaped slaughter,",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
6191,"and a few babies were born after the cataclysm--but only two boys, and",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
6192,they both died.,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
6193,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
6194,"For five or ten years they worked together, growing stronger and wiser",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
6195,"and more and more mutually attached, and then the miracle happened--one",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
6196,of these young women bore a child. Of course they all thought there must,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
6197,"be a man somewhere, but none was found. Then they decided it must be a",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
6198,"direct gift from the gods, and placed the proud mother in the Temple of",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
6199,"Maaia--their Goddess of Motherhood--under strict watch. And there,",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
6200,"as years passed, this wonder-woman bore child after child, five of",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
6201,them--all girls.,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
6202,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
6203,"I did my best, keenly interested as I have always been in sociology and",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
6204,"social psychology, to reconstruct in my mind the real position of these",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
6205,"ancient women. There were some five or six hundred of them, and they",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
6206,were harem-bred; yet for the few preceding generations they had been,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
6207,reared in the atmosphere of such heroic struggle that the stock must,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
6208,"have been toughened somewhat. Left alone in that terrific orphanhood,",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
6209,"they had clung together, supporting one another and their little",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
6210,"sisters, and developing unknown powers in the stress of new necessity.",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
6211,"To this pain-hardened and work-strengthened group, who had lost not only",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
6212,"the love and care of parents, but the hope of ever having children of",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
6213,"their own, there now dawned the new hope.",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
6214,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
6215,"Here at last was Motherhood, and though it was not for all of them",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"

6217,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
6218,"It may be imagined how those five Daughters of Maaia, Children of the",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
6219,"Temple, Mothers of the Future--they had all the titles that love and",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
6220,hope and reverence could give--were reared. The whole little nation,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
6221,"of women surrounded them with loving service, and waited, between a",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
6222,"boundless hope and an equally boundless despair, to see if they, too,",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
6223,would be mothers.,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
6224,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
6225,And they were! As fast as they reached the age of twenty-five they began,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
6226,"bearing. Each of them, like her mother, bore five daughters. Presently",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
6227,"there were twenty-five New Women, Mothers in their own right, and the",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
6228,whole spirit of the country changed from mourning and mere courageous,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
6229,"resignation to proud joy. The older women, those who remembered men,",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
6230,"died off; the youngest of all the first lot of course died too, after",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
6231,"a while, and by that time there were left one hundred and fifty-five",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
6232,"parthenogenetic women, founding a new race.",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
6233,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
6234,They inherited all that the devoted care of that declining band of,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
6235,original ones could leave them. Their little country was quite safe.,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
6236,Their farms and gardens were all in full production. Such industries,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
6237,as they had were in careful order. The records of their past were all,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
6238,"preserved, and for years the older women had spent their time in the",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
6239,"best teaching they were capable of, that they might leave to the little",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
6240,group of sisters and mothers all they possessed of skill and knowledge.,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
6241,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
6242,"There you have the start of Herland! One family, all descended from one",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"

6244,twenty-five great-granddaughters born; lived as Queen-Priestess-Mother,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
6245,of them all; and died with a nobler pride and a fuller joy than perhaps,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
6246,any human soul has ever known--she alone had founded a new race!,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
6247,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
6248,"The first five daughters had grown up in an atmosphere of holy calm,",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
6249,"of awed watchful waiting, of breathless prayer. To them the longed-for",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"

6251,"twenty-five daughters in turn, with a stronger hope, a richer, wider",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
6252,"outlook, with the devoted love and care of all the surviving population,",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
6253,"grew up as a holy sisterhood, their whole ardent youth looking",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
6254,forward to their great office. And at last they were left alone; the,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
6255,"white-haired First Mother was gone, and this one family, five sisters,",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
6256,"twenty-five first cousins, and a hundred and twenty-five second cousins,",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"

6258,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
6259,"Here you have human beings, unquestionably, but what we were slow in",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
6260,"understanding was how these ultra-women, inheriting only from women, had",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
6261,"eliminated not only certain masculine characteristics, which of",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
6262,"course we did not look for, but so much of what we had always thought",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
6263,essentially feminine.,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
6264,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
6265,The tradition of men as guardians and protectors had quite died out.,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"

6273,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
6274,"Terry, incredulous, even contemptuous, when we were alone, refused to",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"

6283,"""That's a likely story,"" Terry sneered.",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
6284,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
6285,"""Why don't you invent a likelier one?"" I asked him. ""Here ARE the",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"

6288,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
6289,"""I'll admit that,"" he growled. ""And it's a big miss, too. There's not",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"

6292,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
6293,That kind of talk always set Jeff going; and I gradually grew to side,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
6294,"with him. ""Then you don't call a breed of women whose one concern is",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
6295,"motherhood--womanly?"" he asked.",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
6296,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
6297,"""Indeed I don't,"" snapped Terry. ""What does a man care for",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
6298,motherhood--when he hasn't a ghost of a chance at fatherhood? And,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
6299,besides--what's the good of talking sentiment when we are just men,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
6300,together? What a man wants of women is a good deal more than all this,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
6301,"'motherhood'!""",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
6302,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
6303,We were as patient as possible with Terry. He had lived about nine,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"

6305,no chance at any more strenuous excitement than our gymnastics gave,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"

6307,"long with neither Love, Combat, nor Danger to employ his superabundant",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"

6309,I was so much interested intellectually that our confinement did not,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
6310,"wear on me; and as for Jeff, bless his heart!--he enjoyed the society of",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"

6312,but more.,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
6313,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
6314,"As to Terry's criticism, it was true. These women, whose essential",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
6315,"distinction of motherhood was the dominant note of their whole culture,",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
6316,"were strikingly deficient in what we call ""femininity."" This led me very",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
6317,"promptly to the conviction that those ""feminine charms"" we are so fond",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
6318,"of are not feminine at all, but mere reflected masculinity--developed to",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
6319,"please us because they had to please us, and in no way essential to",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"

6356,But very early they recognized the need of improvement as well as,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
6357,"of mere repetition, and devoted their combined intelligence to that",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
6358,problem--how to make the best kind of people. First this was merely the,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
6359,"hope of bearing better ones, and then they recognized that however",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"

6368,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
6369,"You see, they had had no wars. They had had no kings, and no priests,",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
6370,"and no aristocracies. They were sisters, and as they grew, they grew",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
6371,"together--not by competition, but by united action.",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
6372,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
6373,"We tried to put in a good word for competition, and they were keenly",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
6374,"interested. Indeed, we soon found from their earnest questions of us",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
6375,that they were prepared to believe our world must be better than theirs.,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
6376,They were not sure; they wanted to know; but there was no such arrogance,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
6377,about them as might have been expected.,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
6378,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
6379,"We rather spread ourselves, telling of the advantages of competition:",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
6380,"how it developed fine qualities; that without it there would be ""no",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"

6382,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
6383,"""No stimulus to industry,"" they repeated, with that puzzled look we had",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"

6393,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
6394,"""It is not with us,"" they explained gently, ""so it is hard for us to",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"

6397,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
6398,"No, he admitted that he did not mean that. Mothers, he supposed, would",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"

6436,"But just as a clear-eyed, intelligent, perfectly honest, and",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
6437,well-meaning child will frequently jar one's self-esteem by innocent,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
6438,"questions, so did these women, without the slightest appearance of",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
6439,"malice or satire, continually bring up points of discussion which we",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
6440,spent our best efforts in evading.,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
6441,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
6442,"Now that we were fairly proficient in their language, had read a lot",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"

6444,they were able to press their questions closer.,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
6445,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
6446,"So when Jeff admitted the number of ""women wage earners"" we had, they",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
6447,"instantly asked for the total population, for the proportion of adult",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"

6460,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
6461,"Terry put it up to me, saying I was the sociologist, and I explained",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
6462,"that the laws of nature require a struggle for existence, and that in",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
6463,"the struggle the fittest survive, and the unfit perish. In our economic",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
6464,"struggle, I continued, there was always plenty of opportunity for the",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
6465,"fittest to reach the top, which they did, in great numbers, particularly",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
6466,in our country; that where there was severe economic pressure the lowest,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
6467,"classes of course felt it the worst, and that among the poorest of all",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"

6472,"""About one-third, then, belong to the poorest class,"" observed Moadine",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"

6476,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
6477,"Jeff--he was getting as bad as they were--solemnly replied that, on the",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
6478,"contrary, the poorer they were, the more children they had. That too, he",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
6479,"explained, was a law of nature: ""Reproduction is in inverse proportion",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"

6491,"""we are going to have the pleasure of showing you over our little land",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"

6496,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
6497,"Terry brightened up immensely at this news, and reconciled himself to",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
6498,the renewed demands upon our capacity as teachers. It was lucky that we,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
6499,"knew so little, really, and had no books to refer to, else, I fancy we",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
6500,"might all be there yet, teaching those eager-minded women about the rest",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
6501,of the world.,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
6502,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
6503,"As to geography, they had the tradition of the Great Sea, beyond the",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
6504,mountains; and they could see for themselves the endless thick-forested,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
6505,plains below them--that was all. But from the few records of their,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
6506,"ancient condition--not ""before the flood"" with them, but before that",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
6507,mighty quake which had cut them off so completely--they were aware that,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
6508,there were other peoples and other countries.,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
6509,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
6510,In geology they were quite ignorant.,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
6511,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
6512,"As to anthropology, they had those same remnants of information about",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
6513,"other peoples, and the knowledge of the savagery of the occupants of",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
6514,"those dim forests below. Nevertheless, they had inferred (marvelously",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
6515,keen on inference and deduction their minds were!) the existence and,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"

6530,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"

6532,"simpler and more concrete sciences, wherein the subject matter was at",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
6533,"hand and they had but to exercise their minds upon it, the results were",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
6534,"surprising. They had worked out a chemistry, a botany, a physics,",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
6535,"with all the blends where a science touches an art, or merges into",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
6536,"an industry, to such fullness of knowledge as made us feel like",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"

6538,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
6539,"Also we found this out--as soon as we were free of the country, and",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"

6545,"foresters, all over the country, as well as those in the towns, and",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
6546,everywhere there was the same high level of intelligence. Some knew far,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
6547,"more than others about one thing--they were specialized, of course; but",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
6548,"all of them knew more about everything--that is, about everything the",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"

6576,"What they were doing with us was like--like--well, say like Napoleon",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
6577,extracting military information from a few illiterate peasants. They,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
6578,"knew just what to ask, and just what use to make of it; they had",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
6579,mechanical appliances for disseminating information almost equal to ours,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
6580,"at home; and by the time we were led forth to lecture, our audiences",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
6581,had thoroughly mastered a well-arranged digest of all we had previously,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
6582,"given to our teachers, and were prepared with such notes and questions",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"

6592,"a good deal, but nothing seemed to amuse them more; they would gather",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
6593,"around and watch him as if it was an exhibition, politely, but with",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"

6662,"They began with a really high degree of social development, something",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
6663,like that of Ancient Egypt or Greece. Then they suffered the loss of,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
6664,"everything masculine, and supposed at first that all human power and",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"

6936,"feeling, and, apparently, untrammeled by any injurious influences.",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
6937,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
6938,Our first step of comparative freedom was a personally conducted tour of,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
6939,"the country. No pentagonal bodyguard now! Only our special tutors,",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
6940,and we got on famously with them. Jeff said he loved Zava like an,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
6941,"aunt--""only jollier than any aunt I ever saw""; Somel and I were as",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
6942,chummy as could be--the best of friends; but it was funny to watch Terry,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
6943,"and Moadine. She was patient with him, and courteous, but it was like",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
6944,"the patience and courtesy of some great man, say a skilled, experienced",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
6945,"diplomat, with a schoolgirl. Her grave acquiescence with his most",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
6946,"preposterous expression of feeling; her genial laughter, not only",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
6947,"with, but, I often felt, at him--though impeccably polite; her",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
6948,"innocent questions, which almost invariably led him to say more than he",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
6949,intended--Jeff and I found it all amusing to watch.,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
6950,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
6951,He never seemed to recognize that quiet background of superiority. When,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
6952,she dropped an argument he always thought he had silenced her; when she,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
6953,laughed he thought it tribute to his wit.,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
6954,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
6955,I hated to admit to myself how much Terry had sunk in my esteem. Jeff,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
6956,"felt it too, I am sure; but neither of us admitted it to the other.",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
6957,"At home we had measured him with other men, and, though we knew his",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
6958,"failings, he was by no means an unusual type. We knew his virtues too,",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
6959,and they had always seemed more prominent than the faults. Measured,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
6960,"among women--our women at home, I mean--he had always stood high. He",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
6961,"was visibly popular. Even where his habits were known, there was no",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
6962,discrimination against him; in some cases his reputation for what was,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
6963,"felicitously termed ""gaiety"" seemed a special charm.",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
6964,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
6965,"But here, against the calm wisdom and quiet restrained humor of these",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
6966,"women, with only that blessed Jeff and my inconspicuous self to compare",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
6967,"with, Terry did stand out rather strong.",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
6968,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
6969,"As ""a man among men,"" he didn't; as a man among--I shall have to say,",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
6970,"""females,"" he didn't; his intense masculinity seemed only fit complement",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
6971,to their intense femininity. But here he was all out of drawing.,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
6972,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
6973,"Moadine was a big woman, with a balanced strength that seldom showed.",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
6974,Her eye was as quietly watchful as a fencer's. She maintained a pleasant,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
6975,"relation with her charge, but I doubt if many, even in that country,",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
6976,could have done as well.,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
6977,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
6978,"He called her ""Maud,"" amongst ourselves, and said she was ""a good old",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"

6984,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
6985,"""Don't you people have but one name?"" he asked one day, after we",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
6986,"had been introduced to a whole group of them, all with pleasant,",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
6987,"few-syllabled strange names, like the ones we knew.",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
6988,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
6989,"""Oh yes,"" Moadine told him. ""A good many of us have another, as we get",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
6990,on in life--a descriptive one. That is the name we earn. Sometimes even,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
6991,"that is changed, or added to, in an unusually rich life. Such as our",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
6992,"present Land Mother--what you call president or king, I believe. She",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
6993,"was called Mera, even as a child; that means 'thinker.' Later there",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
6994,"was added Du--Du-Mera--the wise thinker, and now we all know her as",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"

6998,"air. ""No family name?""",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
6999,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
7000,"""Why no,"" she said. ""Why should we? We are all descended from a common",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
7001,"source--all one 'family' in reality. You see, our comparatively brief",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
7002,"and limited history gives us that advantage at least.""",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
7003,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
7004,"""But does not each mother want her own child to bear her name?"" I asked.",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
7005,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
7006,"""No--why should she? The child has its own.""",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"

7009,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
7010,"""We keep the most careful records,"" said Somel. ""Each one of us has our",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
7011,exact line of descent all the way back to our dear First Mother. There,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
7012,are many reasons for doing that. But as to everyone knowing which child,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
7013,"belongs to which mother--why should she?""",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
7014,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
7015,"Here, as in so many other instances, we were led to feel the difference",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
7016,between the purely maternal and the paternal attitude of mind. The,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
7017,element of personal pride seemed strangely lacking.,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
7018,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
7019,"""How about your other works?"" asked Jeff. ""Don't you sign your names to",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"

7021,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
7022,"""Yes, surely, we are all glad and proud to. Not only books and statues,",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
7023,"but all kinds of work. You will find little names on the houses, on the",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"

7033,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
7034,"""But we have! We're magnificently proud of them,"" she insisted.",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
7035,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
7036,"""Then why not sign 'em?"" said Terry triumphantly.",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
7037,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
7038,"Moadine turned to him with her slightly quizzical smile. ""Because the",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
7039,"finished product is not a private one. When they are babies, we do speak",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
7040,"of them, at times, as 'Essa's Lato,' or 'Novine's Amel'; but that is",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
7041,"merely descriptive and conversational. In the records, of course,",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
7042,the child stands in her own line of mothers; but in dealing with it,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
7043,"personally it is Lato, or Amel, without dragging in its ancestors.""",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
7044,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
7045,"""But have you names enough to give a new one to each child?""",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"

7047,"""Assuredly we have, for each living generation.""",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
7048,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
7049,"Then they asked about our methods, and found first that ""we"" did so and",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
7050,"so, and then that other nations did differently. Upon which they wanted",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
7051,to know which method has been proved best--and we had to admit that,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
7052,"so far as we knew there had been no attempt at comparison, each people",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
7053,"pursuing its own custom in the fond conviction of superiority, and",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
7054,either despising or quite ignoring the others.,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
7055,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
7056,With these women the most salient quality in all their institutions was,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
7057,reasonableness. When I dug into the records to follow out any line of,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
7058,"development, that was the most astonishing thing--the conscious effort",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
7059,to make it better.,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
7060,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
7061,"They had early observed the value of certain improvements, had easily",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
7062,"inferred that there was room for more, and took the greatest pains to",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
7063,develop two kinds of minds--the critic and inventor. Those who showed,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
7064,"an early tendency to observe, to discriminate, to suggest, were given",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
7065,special training for that function; and some of their highest officials,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
7066,spent their time in the most careful study of one or another branch of,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
7067,"work, with a view to its further improvement.",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
7068,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
7069,In each generation there was sure to arrive some new mind to detect,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
7070,faults and show need of alterations; and the whole corps of inventors,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
7071,"was at hand to apply their special faculty at the point criticized, and",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
7072,offer suggestions.,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
7073,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
7074,We had learned by this time not to open a discussion on any of their,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
7075,characteristics without first priming ourselves to answer questions,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
7076,about our own methods; so I kept rather quiet on this matter of,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
7077,conscious improvement. We were not prepared to show our way was better.,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
7078,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
7079,"There was growing in our minds, at least in Jeff's and mine, a",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
7080,keen appreciation of the advantages of this strange country and its,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
7081,management. Terry remained critical. We laid most of it to his nerves.,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
7082,He certainly was irritable.,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
7083,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
7084,The most conspicuous feature of the whole land was the perfection of,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
7085,its food supply. We had begun to notice from that very first walk in the,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
7086,"forest, the first partial view from our 'plane. Now we were taken to see",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
7087,"this mighty garden, and shown its methods of culture.",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
7088,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
7089,"The country was about the size of Holland, some ten or twelve",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
7090,thousand square miles. One could lose a good many Hollands along the,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
7091,forest-smothered flanks of those mighty mountains. They had a population,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
7092,"of about three million--not a large one, but quality is something. Three",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
7093,"million is quite enough to allow for considerable variation, and these",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
7094,people varied more widely than we could at first account for.,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
7095,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
7096,Terry had insisted that if they were parthenogenetic they'd be as alike,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
7097,as so many ants or aphids; he urged their visible differences as proof,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
7098,that there must be men--somewhere.,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
7099,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
7100,"But when we asked them, in our later, more intimate conversations, how",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
7101,"they accounted for so much divergence without cross-fertilization,",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
7102,"they attributed it partly to the careful education, which followed each",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
7103,"slight tendency to differ, and partly to the law of mutation. This they",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
7104,"had found in their work with plants, and fully proven in their own case.",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
7105,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
7106,"Physically they were more alike than we, as they lacked all morbid or",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
7107,"excessive types. They were tall, strong, healthy, and beautiful as a",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
7108,"race, but differed individually in a wide range of feature, coloring,",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
7109,and expression.,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
7110,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
7111,"""But surely the most important growth is in mind--and in the things we",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
7112,"make,"" urged Somel. ""Do you find your physical variation accompanied by",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
7113,"a proportionate variation in ideas, feelings, and products? Or, among",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
7114,"people who look more alike, do you find their internal life and their",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
7115,"work as similar?""",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
7116,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
7117,"We were rather doubtful on this point, and inclined to hold that there",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
7118,was more chance of improvement in greater physical variation.,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
7119,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
7120,"""It certainly should be,"" Zava admitted. ""We have always thought it a",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
7121,grave initial misfortune to have lost half our little world. Perhaps,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
7122,"that is one reason why we have so striven for conscious improvement.""",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
7123,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
7124,"""But acquired traits are not transmissible,"" Terry declared. ""Weissman",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
7125,"has proved that.""",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
7126,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
7127,"They never disputed our absolute statements, only made notes of them.",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
7128,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
7129,"""If that is so, then our improvement must be due either to mutation, or",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
7130,"solely to education,"" she gravely pursued. ""We certainly have improved.",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
7131,It may be that all these higher qualities were latent in the original,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
7132,"mother, that careful education is bringing them out, and that our",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
7133,"personal differences depend on slight variations in prenatal condition.""",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
7134,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
7135,"""I think it is more in your accumulated culture,"" Jeff suggested. ""And",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
7136,in the amazing psychic growth you have made. We know very little about,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
7137,"methods of real soul culture--and you seem to know a great deal.""",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
7138,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
7139,"Be that as it might, they certainly presented a higher level of active",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
7140,"intelligence, and of behavior, than we had so far really grasped. Having",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
7141,known in our lives several people who showed the same delicate courtesy,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
7142,"and were equally pleasant to live with, at least when they wore their",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
7143,"""company manners,"" we had assumed that our companions were a carefully",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
7144,chosen few. Later we were more and more impressed that all this gentle,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
7145,"breeding was breeding; that they were born to it, reared in it, that it",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
7146,was as natural and universal with them as the gentleness of doves or the,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
7147,alleged wisdom of serpents.,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
7148,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
7149,"As for the intelligence, I confess that this was the most impressive",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
7150,"and, to me, most mortifying, of any single feature of Herland. We soon",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
7151,ceased to comment on this or other matters which to them were such,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
7152,obvious commonplaces as to call forth embarrassing questions about our,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
7153,own conditions.,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
7154,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
7155,"This was nowhere better shown than in that matter of food supply, which",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
7156,I will now attempt to describe.,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
7157,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
7158,"Having improved their agriculture to the highest point, and carefully",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
7159,estimated the number of persons who could comfortably live on their,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
7160,"square miles; having then limited their population to that number, one",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
7161,would think that was all there was to be done. But they had not thought,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
7162,so. To them the country was a unit--it was theirs. They themselves were,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
7163,"a unit, a conscious group; they thought in terms of the community. As",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
7164,"such, their time-sense was not limited to the hopes and ambitions of an",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
7165,"individual life. Therefore, they habitually considered and carried out",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
7166,plans for improvement which might cover centuries.,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
7167,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
7168,"I had never seen, had scarcely imagined, human beings undertaking such",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
7169,a work as the deliberate replanting of an entire forest area with,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
7170,different kinds of trees. Yet this seemed to them the simplest common,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
7171,"sense, like a man's plowing up an inferior lawn and reseeding it. Now",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
7172,"every tree bore fruit--edible fruit, that is. In the case of one",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
7173,"tree, in which they took especial pride, it had originally no fruit at",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
7174,"all--that is, none humanly edible--yet was so beautiful that they wished",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
7175,"to keep it. For nine hundred years they had experimented, and now",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
7176,"showed us this particularly lovely graceful tree, with a profuse crop of",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
7177,nutritious seeds.,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
7178,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
7179,"They had early decided that trees were the best food plants, requiring",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
7180,"far less labor in tilling the soil, and bearing a larger amount of food",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
7181,for the same ground space; also doing much to preserve and enrich the,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
7182,soil.,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
7183,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
7184,"Due regard had been paid to seasonable crops, and their fruit and nuts,",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
7185,"grains and berries, kept on almost the year through.",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
7186,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
7187,"On the higher part of the country, near the backing wall of mountains,",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
7188,"they had a real winter with snow. Toward the south-eastern point, where",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
7189,"there was a large valley with a lake whose outlet was subterranean, the",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
7190,"climate was like that of California, and citrus fruits, figs, and olives",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
7191,grew abundantly.,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
7192,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
7193,What impressed me particularly was their scheme of fertilization. Here,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
7194,was this little shut-in piece of land where one would have thought an,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
7195,ordinary people would have been starved out long ago or reduced to an,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
7196,annual struggle for life. These careful culturists had worked out a,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
7197,perfect scheme of refeeding the soil with all that came out of it. All,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
7198,"the scraps and leavings of their food, plant waste from lumber work or",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
7199,"textile industry, all the solid matter from the sewage, properly treated",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
7200,and combined--everything which came from the earth went back to it.,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
7201,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
7202,The practical result was like that in any healthy forest; an,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
7203,"increasingly valuable soil was being built, instead of the progressive",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
7204,impoverishment so often seen in the rest of the world.,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
7205,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
7206,When this first burst upon us we made such approving comments that they,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
7207,were surprised that such obvious common sense should be praised; asked,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
7208,"what our methods were; and we had some difficulty in--well, in",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
7209,"diverting them, by referring to the extent of our own land, and",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
7210,the--admitted--carelessness with which we had skimmed the cream of it.,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
7211,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
7212,At least we thought we had diverted them. Later I found that besides,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
7213,"keeping a careful and accurate account of all we told them, they had a",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
7214,"sort of skeleton chart, on which the things we said and the things we",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
7215,palpably avoided saying were all set down and studied. It really was,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"

7387,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
7388,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
7389,"At last Terry's ambition was realized. We were invited, always",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
7390,"courteously and with free choice on our part, to address general",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
7391,audiences and classes of girls.,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
7392,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
7393,"I remember the first time--and how careful we were about our clothes,",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
7394,"and our amateur barbering. Terry, in particular, was fussy to a degree",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
7395,"about the cut of his beard, and so critical of our combined efforts,",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
7396,that we handed him the shears and told him to please himself. We,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
7397,began to rather prize those beards of ours; they were almost our sole,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
7398,"distinction among those tall and sturdy women, with their cropped hair",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
7399,"and sexless costume. Being offered a wide selection of garments, we had",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
7400,"chosen according to our personal taste, and were surprised to find,",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
7401,"on meeting large audiences, that we were the most highly decorated,",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
7402,especially Terry.,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
7403,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
7404,"He was a very impressive figure, his strong features softened by the",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
7405,somewhat longer hair--though he made me trim it as closely as I knew,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
7406,"how; and he wore his richly embroidered tunic with its broad, loose",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
7407,"girdle with quite a Henry V air. Jeff looked more like--well, like a",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
7408,"Huguenot Lover; and I don't know what I looked like, only that I felt",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
7409,very comfortable. When I got back to our own padded armor and its,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"

7412,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
7413,"We scanned that audience, looking for the three bright faces we knew;",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
7414,"but they were not to be seen. Just a multitude of girls: quiet, eager,",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
7415,"watchful, all eyes and ears to listen and learn.",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
7416,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
7417,"We had been urged to give, as fully as we cared to, a sort of synopsis",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"

7419,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"

7423,"helped one another all over the globe, sharing your discoveries, pooling",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
7424,"your progress. How wonderful, how supremely beautiful your civilization",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
7425,"must be!""",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"

7430,"made a sort of digest of what we have learned from you, and it has been",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
7431,"eagerly absorbed, all over the country. Perhaps you would like to see",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"

7433,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"

7435,"women, unavoidably ignorant of what to us was the basic commonplace of",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
7436,"knowledge, had seemed on the plane of children, or of savages. What we",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
7437,"had been forced to admit, with growing acquaintance, was that they",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
7438,"were ignorant as Plato and Aristotle were, but with a highly developed",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
7439,mentality quite comparable to that of Ancient Greece.,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"

7441,Far be it from me to lumber these pages with an account of what we so,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
7442,imperfectly strove to teach them. The memorable fact is what they taught,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
7443,"us, or some faint glimpse of it. And at present, our major interest was",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
7444,"not at all in the subject matter of our talk, but in the audience.",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
7445,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
7446,"Girls--hundreds of them--eager, bright-eyed, attentive young faces;",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"

7449,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
7450,"Our special guides, who were on the platform with us, and sometimes",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
7451,"aided in clarifying a question or, oftener, an answer, noticed this",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"

7458,"Willing! We were impatient and said as much, at which I saw a flickering",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"

7460,"things waiting to talk to us, a sudden question crossed my mind: ""What",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
7461,"was their point of view? What did they think of us?"" We learned that",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
7462,later.,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
7463,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
7464,"Terry plunged in among those young creatures with a sort of rapture,",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
7465,"somewhat as a glad swimmer takes to the sea. Jeff, with a rapt look on",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
7466,"his high-bred face, approached as to a sacrament. But I was a little",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
7467,"chilled by that last thought of mine, and kept my eyes open. I found",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
7468,"time to watch Jeff, even while I was surrounded by an eager group of",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
7469,"questioners--as we all were--and saw how his worshipping eyes, his grave",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
7470,"courtesy, pleased and drew some of them; while others, rather stronger",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
7471,"spirits they looked to be, drew away from his group to Terry's or mine.",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
7472,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
7473,"I watched Terry with special interest, knowing how he had longed for",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
7474,"this time, and how irresistible he had always been at home. And I could",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
7475,"see, just in snatches, of course, how his suave and masterful approach",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
7476,"seemed to irritate them; his too-intimate glances were vaguely resented,",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
7477,"his compliments puzzled and annoyed. Sometimes a girl would flush, not",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
7478,"with drooped eyelids and inviting timidity, but with anger and a quick",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
7479,"lift of the head. Girl after girl turned on her heel and left him, till",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
7480,"he had but a small ring of questioners, and they, visibly, were the",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
7481,"least ""girlish"" of the lot.",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
7482,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
7483,"I saw him looking pleased at first, as if he thought he was making",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
7484,"a strong impression; but, finally, casting a look at Jeff, or me, he",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
7485,seemed less pleased--and less.,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
7486,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
7487,"As for me, I was most agreeably surprised. At home I never",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
7488,"was ""popular."" I had my girl friends, good ones, but they were",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
7489,"friends--nothing else. Also they were of somewhat the same clan, not",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"

7491,I found my crowd was the largest.,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
7492,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
7493,"I have to generalize, of course, rather telescoping many impressions;",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
7494,but the first evening was a good sample of the impression we made. Jeff,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
7495,"had a following, if I may call it that, of the more sentimental--though",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
7496,"that's not the word I want. The less practical, perhaps; the girls who",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
7497,"were artists of some sort, ethicists, teachers--that kind.",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
7498,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
7499,"Terry was reduced to a rather combative group: keen, logical, inquiring",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"

7680,"great--big, all through. If I had known more of those women, as",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
7681,"intimately, I should not have found her so unique; but even among them",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"

7790,made things clearer to Jeff and Celis. But Terry would not listen to,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
7791,reason.,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
7792,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
7793,"He was madly in love with Alima. He wanted to take her by storm, and",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
7794,nearly lost her forever.,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
7795,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
7796,"You see, if a man loves a girl who is in the first place young and",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
7797,inexperienced; who in the second place is educated with a background,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
7798,"of caveman tradition, a middle-ground of poetry and romance, and a",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
7799,foreground of unspoken hope and interest all centering upon the one,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
7800,"Event; and who has, furthermore, absolutely no other hope or interest",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
7801,"worthy of the name--why, it is a comparatively easy matter to sweep",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
7802,her off her feet with a dashing attack. Terry was a past master in this,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
7803,"process. He tried it here, and Alima was so affronted, so repelled, that",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
7804,it was weeks before he got near enough to try again.,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
7805,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
7806,"The more coldly she denied him, the hotter his determination; he was",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"

7808,"laughter, gifts and such ""attentions"" we could not bring to bear, pathos",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
7809,and complaint of cruelty stirred only a reasoning inquiry. It took Terry,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
7810,a long time.,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
7811,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
7812,I doubt if she ever accepted her strange lover as fully as did Celis,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"

7814,reservations.,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
7815,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
7816,But I think Alima retained some faint vestige of long-descended feeling,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
7817,which made Terry more possible to her than to others; and that she had,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
7818,made up her mind to the experiment and hated to renounce it.,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
7819,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
7820,"However it came about, we all three at length achieved full",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"

7924,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
7925,"To these women we came, filled with the ideas, convictions, traditions,",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"

7928,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
7929,"However much, or little, of true sex-feeling there was between us, it",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
7930,"phrased itself in their minds in terms of friendship, the one purely",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
7931,"personal love they knew, and of ultimate parentage. Visibly we were not",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"

7933,friends.,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
7934,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
7935,That we should pair off together in our courting days was natural to,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
7936,"them; that we three should remain much together, as they did themselves,",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
7937,"was also natural. We had as yet no work, so we hung about them in their",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
7938,"forest tasks; that was natural, too.",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"

7969,"""Why yes. The children play about, and the mother has charge of it all.",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
7970,"There are servants, of course.""",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
7971,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
7972,"It seemed so obvious, so natural to Terry, that he always grew",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"

7988,"servants. Now what do those women DO?""",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
7989,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
7990,"We explained as best we might. We talked of ""social duties,""",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
7991,disingenuously banking on their not interpreting the words as we did; we,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
7992,"talked of hospitality, entertainment, and various ""interests."" All the",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
7993,time we knew that to these large-minded women whose whole mental outlook,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"

7995,inconceivable.,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
7996,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
7997,"""We cannot really understand it,"" Ellador concluded. ""We are only half",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
7998,a people. We have our woman-ways and they have their man-ways and their,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
7999,"both-ways. We have worked out a system of living which is, of course,",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
8000,"limited. They must have a broader, richer, better one. I should like to",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
8001,"see it.""",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"

8004,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
8005,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
8006,"""There's nothing to smoke,"" complained Terry. He was in the midst of a",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
8007,"prolonged quarrel with Alima, and needed a sedative. ""There's nothing to",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
8008,drink. These blessed women have no pleasant vices. I wish we could get,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
8009,"out of here!""",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
8010,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
8011,This wish was vain. We were always under a certain degree of,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
8012,watchfulness. When Terry burst forth to tramp the streets at night he,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
8013,"always found a ""Colonel"" here or there; and when, on an occasion of",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
8014,"fierce though temporary despair, he had plunged to the cliff edge with",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
8015,"some vague view to escape, he found several of them close by. We were",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
8016,free--but there was a string to it.,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
8017,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
8018,"""They've no unpleasant ones, either,"" Jeff reminded him.",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"

8024,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
8025,"I was thinking of Ellador's eyes when they gave me a certain look, a",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
8026,look she did not at all realize.,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
8027,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
8028,"Jeff was equally incensed. ""I don't know what 'virtues of women' you",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"

8054,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
8055,There was something to this criticism. The years of pioneering lay far,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"

8058,"plenty, the steady health, the large good will and smooth management",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"

8436,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
8437,There was no mystery in their methods. Being adapted to children it was,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"

8445,"feasible, to use and control their own bodies, and never did I see such",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
8446,"sure-footed, steady-handed, clear-headed little things. It was a joy",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"

8448,"but, a little later, on a sort of rubber rail raised an inch or two",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
8449,"above the soft turf or heavy rugs, and falling off with shrieks of",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
8450,"infant joy, to rush back to the end of the line and try again. Surely we",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
8451,have noticed how children love to get up on something and walk along it!,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"

8483,"When I asked her about it, she tried at first to tell me, and then,",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
8484,"seeing me flounder, asked for more information about ours. She soon",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
8485,"found that we had many, that they varied widely, but had some points",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
8486,"in common. A clear methodical luminous mind had my Ellador, not only",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"

8489,"She made a sort of chart, superimposing the different religions as",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"

8494,"this Power, and the things which must be done or not done because of",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"

8496,"through successive stages of bloodthirsty, sensual, proud, and cruel",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"

8588,"felt beneath and behind them an upholding, unfailing, serviceable",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
8589,love--perhaps it was really the accumulated mother-love of the race they,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"

8660,I explained that the God of the Christian world was really the ancient,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
8661,"Hebrew God, and that we had simply taken over the patriarchal idea--that",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
8662,ancient one which quite inevitably clothed its thought of God with the,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
8663,"attributes of the patriarchal ruler, the grandfather.",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
8664,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
8665,"""I see,"" she said eagerly, after I had explained the genesis and",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
8666,"development of our religious ideals. ""They lived in separate groups,",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
8667,"with a male head, and he was probably a little--domineering?""",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
8668,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
8669,"""No doubt of that,"" I agreed.",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
8670,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
8671,"""And we live together without any 'head,' in that sense--just our chosen",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
8672,"leaders--that DOES make a difference.""",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
8673,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
8674,"""Your difference is deeper than that,"" I assured her. ""It is in your",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
8675,common motherhood. Your children grow up in a world where everybody,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
8676,loves them. They find life made rich and happy for them by the diffused,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
8677,love and wisdom of all mothers. So it is easy for you to think of God in,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
8678,the terms of a similar diffused and competent love. I think you are far,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
8679,"nearer right than we are.""",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
8680,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
8681,"""What I cannot understand,"" she pursued carefully, ""is your preservation",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
8682,of such a very ancient state of mind. This patriarchal idea you tell me,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
8683,"is thousands of years old?""",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
8684,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
8685,"""Oh yes--four, five, six thousand--every so many.""",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"

8687,"""And you have made wonderful progress in those years--in other things?""",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
8688,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
8689,"""We certainly have. But religion is different. You see, our religions",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
8690,"come from behind us, and are initiated by some great teacher who is",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
8691,"dead. He is supposed to have known the whole thing and taught it,",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"

8695,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
8696,"""Oh--there it was different. The Hebrew religion is an accumulation of",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
8697,"extremely ancient traditions, some far older than their people, and grew",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
8698,"by accretion down the ages. We consider it inspired--'the Word of God.'""",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"

8708,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
8709,"""Apart from that,"" she pursued, ""what I cannot understand is why you",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"

8711,"others, haven't you?""",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
8712,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
8713,"""Pretty generally,"" I agreed. ""But this we call 'revealed religion,'",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
8714,and think it is final. But tell me more about these little temples of,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
8715,"yours,"" I urged. ""And these Temple Mothers you run to.""",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
8716,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"

8719,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
8720,"They developed their central theory of a Loving Power, and assumed that",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
8721,its relation to them was motherly--that it desired their welfare and,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
8722,"especially their development. Their relation to it, similarly, was",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
8723,"filial, a loving appreciation and a glad fulfillment of its high",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
8724,"purposes. Then, being nothing if not practical, they set their keen",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
8725,and active minds to discover the kind of conduct expected of them. This,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
8726,worked out in a most admirable system of ethics. The principle of Love,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
8727,was universally recognized--and used.,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
8728,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
8729,"Patience, gentleness, courtesy, all that we call ""good breeding,"" was",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
8730,part of their code of conduct. But where they went far beyond us was,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
8731,in the special application of religious feeling to every field of,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
8732,"life. They had no ritual, no little set of performances called ""divine",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
8733,"service,"" save those religious pageants I have spoken of, and those were",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
8734,"as much educational as religious, and as much social as either. But they",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
8735,had a clear established connection between everything they did--and,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
8736,"God. Their cleanliness, their health, their exquisite order, the rich",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
8737,"peaceful beauty of the whole land, the happiness of the children, and",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
8738,above all the constant progress they made--all this was their religion.,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
8739,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
8740,"They applied their minds to the thought of God, and worked out the",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
8741,theory that such an inner power demanded outward expression. They lived,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
8742,as if God was real and at work within them.,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
8743,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
8744,As for those little temples everywhere--some of the women were more,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
8745,"skilled, more temperamentally inclined, in this direction, than others.",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
8746,"These, whatever their work might be, gave certain hours to the Temple",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
8747,"Service, which meant being there with all their love and wisdom and",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
8748,"trained thought, to smooth out rough places for anyone who needed it.",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
8749,"Sometimes it was a real grief, very rarely a quarrel, most often a",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"

8752,help.,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"

8755,someone more specially experienced in that line of thought.,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
8756,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
8757,Here was a religion which gave to the searching mind a rational basis,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
8758,"in life, the concept of an immense Loving Power working steadily out",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
8759,"through them, toward good. It gave to the ""soul"" that sense of contact",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
8760,"with the inmost force, of perception of the uttermost purpose, which we",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
8761,"always crave. It gave to the ""heart"" the blessed feeling of being loved,",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
8762,"loved and UNDERSTOOD. It gave clear, simple, rational directions as",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
8763,to how we should live--and why. And for ritual it gave first those,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
8764,"triumphant group demonstrations, when with a union of all the arts,",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
8765,the revivifying combination of great multitudes moved rhythmically with,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
8766,"march and dance, song and music, among their own noblest products",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
8767,"and the open beauty of their groves and hills. Second, it gave these",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
8768,numerous little centers of wisdom where the least wise could go to the,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
8769,most wise and be helped.,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"

8952,"spoke of, and the whole great place pulsed with feeling--the deep awe,",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
8953,"the sweet hope, the wondering expectation of a new miracle.",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
8954,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
8955,"""There has been nothing like this in the country since our Motherhood",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
8956,"began!"" Somel said softly to me, while we watched the symbolic marches.",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
8957,"""You see, it is the dawn of a new era. You don't know how much you mean",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
8958,to us. It is not only Fatherhood--that marvelous dual parentage to,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
8959,which we are strangers--the miracle of union in life-giving--but it is,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
8960,Brotherhood. You are the rest of the world. You join us to our kind--to,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
8961,all the strange lands and peoples we have never seen. We hope to know,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
8962,"them--to love and help them--and to learn of them. Ah! You cannot know!""",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
8963,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
8964,Thousands of voices rose in the soaring climax of that great Hymn of The,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
8965,"Coming Life. By the great Altar of Motherhood, with its crown of fruit",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
8966,"and flowers, stood a new one, crowned as well. Before the Great Over",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
8967,"Mother of the Land and her ring of High Temple Counsellors, before that",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"

8975,CHAPTER 11. Our Difficulties,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
8976,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
8977,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
8978,"We say, ""Marriage is a lottery""; also ""Marriages are made in",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
8979,"Heaven""--but this is not so widely accepted as the other.",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
8980,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
8981,"We have a well-founded theory that it is best to marry ""in one's class,""",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
8982,"and certain well-grounded suspicions of international marriages, which",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
8983,"seem to persist in the interests of social progress, rather than in",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
8984,those of the contracting parties.,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
8985,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
8986,"But no combination of alien races, of color, of caste, or creed, was",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
8987,"ever so basically difficult to establish as that between us, three",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
8988,"modern American men, and these three women of Herland.",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
8989,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
8990,It is all very well to say that we should have been frank about it,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
8991,beforehand. We had been frank. We had discussed--at least Ellador and,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
8992,"I had--the conditions of The Great Adventure, and thought the path",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
8993,"was clear before us. But there are some things one takes for granted,",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
8994,"supposes are mutually understood, and to which both parties may",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
8995,repeatedly refer without ever meaning the same thing.,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
8996,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
8997,The differences in the education of the average man and woman are,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
8998,"great enough, but the trouble they make is not mostly for the man; he",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
8999,generally carries out his own views of the case. The woman may have,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
9000,imagined the conditions of married life to be different; but what she,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
9001,"imagined, was ignorant of, or might have preferred, did not seriously",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
9002,matter.,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
9003,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
9004,"I can see clearly and speak calmly about this now, writing after a lapse",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
9005,"of years, years full of growth and education, but at the time it was",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
9006,rather hard sledding for all of us--especially for Terry. Poor Terry!,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
9007,"You see, in any other imaginable marriage among the peoples of the",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
9008,"earth, whether the woman were black, red, yellow, brown, or white;",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
9009,"whether she were ignorant or educated, submissive or rebellious, she",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
9010,would have behind her the marriage tradition of our general history.,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
9011,This tradition relates the woman to the man. He goes on with his,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
9012,"business, and she adapts herself to him and to it. Even in citizenship,",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
9013,"by some strange hocus-pocus, that fact of birth and geography was waved",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
9014,"aside, and the woman automatically acquired the nationality of her",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
9015,husband.,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
9016,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
9017,"Well--here were we, three aliens in this land of women. It was small in",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
9018,"area, and the external differences were not so great as to astound us.",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
9019,We did not yet appreciate the differences between the race-mind of this,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
9020,people and ours.,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
9021,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
9022,"In the first place, they were a ""pure stock"" of two thousand",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
9023,uninterrupted years. Where we have some long connected lines of,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
9024,"thought and feeling, together with a wide range of differences, often",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
9025,"irreconcilable, these people were smoothly and firmly agreed on most of",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
9026,"the basic principles of their life; and not only agreed in principle,",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
9027,but accustomed for these sixty-odd generations to act on those,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
9028,principles.,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
9029,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
9030,This is one thing which we did not understand--had made no allowance,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
9031,for. When in our pre-marital discussions one of those dear girls had,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
9032,"said: ""We understand it thus and thus,"" or ""We hold such and such to be",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
9033,"true,"" we men, in our own deep-seated convictions of the power of love,",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
9034,"and our easy views about beliefs and principles, fondly imagined that",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
9035,"we could convince them otherwise. What we imagined, before marriage, did",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
9036,not matter any more than what an average innocent young girl imagines.,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
9037,We found the facts to be different.,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
9038,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
9039,"It was not that they did not love us; they did, deeply and warmly. But",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
9040,"there are you again--what they meant by ""love"" and what we meant by",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
9041,"""love"" were so different.",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
9042,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
9043,"Perhaps it seems rather cold-blooded to say ""we"" and ""they,"" as if we",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
9044,"were not separate couples, with our separate joys and sorrows, but our",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
9045,positions as aliens drove us together constantly. The whole strange,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
9046,experience had made our friendship more close and intimate than it would,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
9047,ever have become in a free and easy lifetime among our own people.,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
9048,"Also, as men, with our masculine tradition of far more than two thousand",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
9049,"years, we were a unit, small but firm, against this far larger unit of",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
9050,feminine tradition.,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
9051,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
9052,I think I can make clear the points of difference without a too painful,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
9053,"explicitness. The more external disagreement was in the matter of ""the",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
9054,"home,"" and the housekeeping duties and pleasures we, by instinct and",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
9055,"long education, supposed to be inherently appropriate to women.",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
9056,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
9057,"I will give two illustrations, one away up, and the other away down, to",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
9058,show how completely disappointed we were in this regard.,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
9059,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
9060,"For the lower one, try to imagine a male ant, coming from some state of",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
9061,"existence where ants live in pairs, endeavoring to set up housekeeping",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
9062,with a female ant from a highly developed anthill. This female ant might,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
9063,"regard him with intense personal affection, but her ideas of parentage",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
9064,and economic management would be on a very different scale from his.,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
9065,"Now, of course, if she was a stray female in a country of pairing ants,",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
9066,he might have had his way with her; but if he was a stray male in an,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
9067,anthill--!,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
9068,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
9069,"For the higher one, try to imagine a devoted and impassioned man trying",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
9070,"to set up housekeeping with a lady angel, a real wings-and-harp-and-halo",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
9071,"angel, accustomed to fulfilling divine missions all over interstellar",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
9072,space. This angel might love the man with an affection quite beyond his,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
9073,"power of return or even of appreciation, but her ideas of service and",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
9074,"duty would be on a very different scale from his. Of course, if she was",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
9075,"a stray angel in a country of men, he might have had his way with her;",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
9076,but if he was a stray man among angels--!,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
9077,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
9078,"Terry, at his worst, in a black fury for which, as a man, I must have",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
9079,"some sympathy, preferred the ant simile. More of Terry and his special",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
9080,troubles later. It was hard on Terry.,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
9081,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
9082,"Jeff--well, Jeff always had a streak that was too good for this world!",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
9083,He's the kind that would have made a saintly priest in parentagearlier,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
9084,"times. He accepted the angel theory, swallowed it whole, tried to force",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
9085,"it on us--with varying effect. He so worshipped Celis, and not only",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
9086,"Celis, but what she represented; he had become so deeply convinced of",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
9087,"the almost supernatural advantages of this country and people, that he",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
9088,"took his medicine like a--I cannot say ""like a man,"" but more as if he",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
9089,wasn't one.,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
9090,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
9091,Don't misunderstand me for a moment. Dear old Jeff was no milksop or,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
9092,"molly-coddle either. He was a strong, brave, efficient man, and an",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
9093,excellent fighter when fighting was necessary. But there was always this,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
9094,"angel streak in him. It was rather a wonder, Terry being so different,",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
9095,"that he really loved Jeff as he did; but it happens so sometimes, in",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
9096,spite of the difference--perhaps because of it.,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
9097,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
9098,"As for me, I stood between. I was no such gay Lothario as Terry, and no",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
9099,such Galahad as Jeff. But for all my limitations I think I had the habit,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
9100,of using my brains in regard to behavior rather more frequently than,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
9101,"either of them. I had to use brain-power now, I can tell you.",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
9102,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
9103,"The big point at issue between us and our wives was, as may easily be",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
9104,"imagined, in the very nature of the relation.",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
9105,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
9106,"""Wives! Don't talk to me about wives!"" stormed Terry. ""They don't know",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
9107,"what the word means.""",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
9108,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
9109,Which is exactly the fact--they didn't. How could they? Back in their,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
9110,prehistoric records of polygamy and slavery there were no ideals of,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
9111,"wifehood as we know it, and since then no possibility of forming such.",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
9112,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
9113,"""The only thing they can think of about a man is FATHERHOOD!"" said Terry",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
9114,"in high scorn. ""FATHERHOOD! As if a man was always wanting to be a",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
9115,"FATHER!""",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
9116,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
9117,"This also was correct. They had their long, wide, deep, rich experience",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
9118,"of Motherhood, and their only perception of the value of a male creature",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
9119,as such was for Fatherhood.,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
9120,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
9121,"Aside from that, of course, was the whole range of personal love, love",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
9122,"which as Jeff earnestly phrased it ""passeth the love of women!"" It did,",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
9123,"too. I can give no idea--either now, after long and happy experience of",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
9124,"it, or as it seemed then, in the first measureless wonder--of the beauty",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
9125,and power of the love they gave us.,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
9126,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
9127,"Even Alima--who had a more stormy temperament than either of the others,",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
9128,"and who, heaven knows, had far more provocation--even Alima was patience",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
9129,"and tenderness and wisdom personified to the man she loved, until",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
9130,he--but I haven't got to that yet.,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
9131,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
9132,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
9133,"These, as Terry put it, ""alleged or so-called wives"" of ours, went right",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
9134,"on with their profession as foresters. We, having no special learnings,",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
9135,"had long since qualified as assistants. We had to do something, if only",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
9136,"to pass the time, and it had to be work--we couldn't be playing forever.",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
9137,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
9138,"This kept us out of doors with those dear girls, and more or less",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
9139,together--too much together sometimes.,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
9140,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
9141,"These people had, it now became clear to us, the highest, keenest, most",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
9142,"delicate sense of personal privacy, but not the faintest idea of that",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
9143,"SOLITUDE A DEUX we are so fond of. They had, every one of them, the ""two",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
9144,"rooms and a bath"" theory realized. From earliest childhood each had",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
9145,"a separate bedroom with toilet conveniences, and one of the marks of",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
9146,coming of age was the addition of an outer room in which to receive,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
9147,friends.,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
9148,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
9149,"Long since we had been given our own two rooms apiece, and as being of a",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
9150,"different sex and race, these were in a separate house. It seemed to be",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
9151,recognized that we should breathe easier if able to free our minds in,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
9152,real seclusion.,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
9153,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
9154,"For food we either went to any convenient eating-house, ordered a meal",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
9155,"brought in, or took it with us to the woods, always and equally good.",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
9156,All this we had become used to and enjoyed--in our courting days.,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
9157,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
9158,After marriage there arose in us a somewhat unexpected urge of feeling,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
9159,that called for a separate house; but this feeling found no response in,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
9160,the hearts of those fair ladies.,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
9161,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
9162,"""We ARE alone, dear,"" Ellador explained to me with gentle patience.",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
9163,"""We are alone in these great forests; we may go and eat in any little",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
9164,"summer-house--just we two, or have a separate table anywhere--or even",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
9165,"have a separate meal in our own rooms. How could we be aloner?""",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
9166,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
9167,This was all very true. We had our pleasant mutual solitude about our,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
9168,"work, and our pleasant evening talks in their apartments or ours; we",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
9169,"had, as it were, all the pleasures of courtship carried right on; but we",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
9170,had no sense of--perhaps it may be called possession.,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
9171,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
9172,"""Might as well not be married at all,"" growled Terry. ""They only got up",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
9173,"that ceremony to please us--please Jeff, mostly. They've no real idea of",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
9174,"being married.""",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
9175,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
9176,"I tried my best to get Ellador's point of view, and naturally I tried to",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
9177,"give her mine. Of course, what we, as men, wanted to make them see was",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
9178,"that there were other, and as we proudly said ""higher,"" uses in this",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
9179,"relation than what Terry called ""mere parentage."" In the highest terms I",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
9180,knew I tried to explain this to Ellador.,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
9181,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
9182,"""Anything higher than for mutual love to hope to give life, as we did?""",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
9183,"she said. ""How is it higher?""",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
9184,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
9185,"""It develops love,"" I explained. ""All the power of beautiful permanent",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
9186,"mated love comes through this higher development.""",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
9187,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
9188,"""Are you sure?"" she asked gently. ""How do you know that it was so",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
9189,developed? There are some birds who love each other so that they mope,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
9190,"and pine if separated, and never pair again if one dies, but they never",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
9191,mate except in the mating season. Among your people do you find high and,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
9192,"lasting affection appearing in proportion to this indulgence?""",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
9193,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
9194,"It is a very awkward thing, sometimes, to have a logical mind.",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"

9196,"Of course I knew about those monogamous birds and beasts too, that mate",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"

9198,stretched the sex relationship beyond its original range. But what of,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
9199,it?,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
9200,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
9201,"""Those are lower forms of life!"" I protested. ""They have no capacity",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
9202,"for faithful and affectionate, and apparently happy--but oh, my dear! my",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
9203,"dear!--what can they know of such a love as draws us together? Why, to",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
9204,touch you--to be near you--to come closer and closer--to lose myself in,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
9205,"you--surely you feel it too, do you not?""",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
9206,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
9207,I came nearer. I seized her hands.,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
9208,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
9209,"Her eyes were on mine, tender radiant, but steady and strong. There was",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
9210,"something so powerful, so large and changeless, in those eyes that",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
9211,I could not sweep her off her feet by my own emotion as I had,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
9212,unconsciously assumed would be the case.,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
9213,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
9214,"It made me feel as, one might imagine, a man might feel who loved a",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"

9225,OUR women for BEING so personal.,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
9226,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
9227,Then I did my earnest best to picture to her the sweet intense joy of,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"

9290,honestly supposed to be a physiological necessity was a psychological,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
9291,"necessity--or so believed. I found, after my ideas of what was essential",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
9292,"had changed, that my feelings changed also. And more than all, I found",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"

9330,"It must not be imagined that I was just repelled, ignored, left to",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
9331,cherish a grievance. Not at all. My happiness was in the hands of a,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
9332,"larger, sweeter womanhood than I had ever imagined. Before our marriage",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
9333,my own ardor had perhaps blinded me to much of this. I was madly in love,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
9334,with not so much what was there as with what I supposed to be there. Now,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
9335,"I found an endlessly beautiful undiscovered country to explore, and in",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
9336,it the sweetest wisdom and understanding. It was as if I had come to,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
9337,"some new place and people, with a desire to eat at all hours, and no",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
9338,"other interests in particular; and as if my hosts, instead of merely",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
9339,"saying, ""You shall not eat,"" had presently aroused in me a lively desire",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
9340,"for music, for pictures, for games, for exercise, for playing in the",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
9341,"water, for running some ingenious machine; and, in the multitude of my",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
9342,"satisfactions, I forgot the one point which was not satisfied, and got",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
9343,along very well until mealtime.,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
9344,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
9345,One of the cleverest and most ingenious of these tricks was only clear,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
9346,"to me many years after, when we were so wholly at one on this subject",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
9347,"that I could laugh at my own predicament then. It was this: You see,",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
9348,"with us, women are kept as different as possible and as feminine as",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
9349,"possible. We men have our own world, with only men in it; we get tired",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
9350,"of our ultra-maleness and turn gladly to the ultra-femaleness. Also,",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
9351,"in keeping our women as feminine as possible, we see to it that when",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
9352,"we turn to them we find the thing we want always in evidence. Well, the",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
9353,atmosphere of this place was anything but seductive. The very numbers,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
9354,"of these human women, always in human relation, made them anything",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
9355,"but alluring. When, in spite of this, my hereditary instincts and",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
9356,"race-traditions made me long for the feminine response in Ellador,",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
9357,"instead of withdrawing so that I should want her more, she deliberately",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
9358,"gave me a little too much of her society.--always de-feminized, as it",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
9359,"were. It was awfully funny, really.",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
9360,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
9361,"Here was I, with an Ideal in mind, for which I hotly longed, and here",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
9362,"was she, deliberately obtruding in the foreground of my consciousness a",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
9363,"Fact--a fact which I coolly enjoyed, but which actually interfered with",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
9364,"what I wanted. I see now clearly enough why a certain kind of man, like",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
9365,"Sir Almroth Wright, resents the professional development of women. It",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
9366,gets in the way of the sex ideal; it temporarily covers and excludes,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
9367,femininity.,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
9368,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
9369,"Of course, in this case, I was so fond of Ellador my friend, of Ellador",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
9370,"my professional companion, that I necessarily enjoyed her society on any",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
9371,terms. Only--when I had had her with me in her de-feminine capacity for,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
9372,"a sixteen-hour day, I could go to my own room and sleep without dreaming",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
9373,about her.,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"

9376,"she did, great superwoman that she was. I couldn't then half comprehend",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
9377,"the skill of it, the wonder. But this I soon began to find: that under",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
9378,"all our cultivated attitude of mind toward women, there is an older,",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
9379,"deeper, more ""natural"" feeling, the restful reverence which looks up to",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"

9385,"When it comes to Terry's part of it, and Alima's, I'm sorry--and",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
9386,I'm ashamed. Of course I blame her somewhat. She wasn't as fine,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
9387,"a psychologist as Ellador, and what's more, I think she had a",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
9388,"far-descended atavistic trace of more marked femaleness, never apparent",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
9389,"till Terry called it out. But when all is said, it doesn't excuse him. I",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
9390,"hadn't realized to the full Terry's character--I couldn't, being a man.",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
9391,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
9392,"The position was the same as with us, of course, only with these",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
9393,"distinctions. Alima, a shade more alluring, and several shades less able",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"

9395,proportionately less reasonable.,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
9396,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
9397,"Things grew strained very soon between them. I fancy at first, when",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
9398,"they were together, in her great hope of parentage and his keen joy of",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
9399,"conquest--that Terry was inconsiderate. In fact, I know it, from things",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
9400,he said.,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
9401,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
9402,"""You needn't talk to me,"" he snapped at Jeff one day, just before",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"

9435,"swearing under his breath. I was taking a walk that night too, but I",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
9436,wasn't in his state of mind. To hear him rage you'd not have believed,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"

9442,and dispassionately. I fancy too--this is pure conjecture--that he,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
9443,"had succeeded in driving Alima beyond her best judgment, her real",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"

9451,assistant detailed to accompany her in her work.,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
9452,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
9453,"Terry had his own ideas, as I've tried to show. I daresay he thought he",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
9454,had a right to do as he did. Perhaps he even convinced himself that,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"

9666,and going faster up to the smooth comfort of their present life. We,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
9667,"had learned a little of their psychology, a much wider field than the",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
9668,"history, but here we could not follow so readily. We were now well used",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"

9672,"This outbreak of Terry's, and the strong reaction against it, gave us",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
9673,a new light on their genuine femininity. This was given me with great,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
9674,clearness by both Ellador and Somel. The feeling was the same--sick,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
9675,"revulsion and horror, such as would be felt at some climactic blasphemy.",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"

9677,"They had no faintest approach to such a thing in their minds, knowing",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"

9791,of her friend--a thought she put away from her at once and forever.,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
9792,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
9793,"""It is better,"" she said to me. ""It is much better that it has not come",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
9794,"to me yet--to us, that is. For if I am to go with you to your country,",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
9795,"we may have 'adventures by sea and land,' as you say [and as in truth we",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
9796,"did], and it might not be at all safe for a baby. So we won't try again,",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
9797,"dear, till it is safe--will we?""",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
9798,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
9799,This was a hard saying for a very loving husband.,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"

9809,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
9810,This was a very stupid saying. Of course I would! For if she wasn't,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
9811,there I should want all of her and have none of her. But if she went,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
9812,along as a sort of sublimated sister--only much closer and warmer than,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
9813,"that, really--why I should have all of her but that one thing. And I",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
9814,"was beginning to find that Ellador's friendship, Ellador's comradeship,",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
9815,"Ellador's sisterly affection, Ellador's perfectly sincere love--none",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
9816,the less deep that she held it back on a definite line of reserve--were,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
9817,enough to live on very happily.,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
9818,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
9819,I find it quite beyond me to describe what this woman was to me. We talk,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
9820,"fine things about women, but in our hearts we know that they are very",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
9821,"limited beings--most of them. We honor them for their functional powers,",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
9822,even while we dishonor them by our use of it; we honor them for their,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
9823,"carefully enforced virtue, even while we show by our own conduct how",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
9824,"little we think of that virtue; we value them, sincerely, for the",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
9825,perverted maternal activities which make our wives the most comfortable,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
9826,"of servants, bound to us for life with the wages wholly at our own",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
9827,"decision, their whole business, outside of the temporary duties of such",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"

9829,"value them, all right, ""in their place,"" which place is the home, where",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"

9842,"was quite clear in his ideas of ""the position of women""), I found that",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
9843,"loving ""up"" was a very good sensation after all. It gave me a queer",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
9844,"feeling, way down deep, as of the stirring of some ancient dim",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
9845,"prehistoric consciousness, a feeling that they were right somehow--that",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
9846,this was the way to feel. It was like--coming home to mother. I don't,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
9847,"mean the underflannels-and-doughnuts mother, the fussy person that waits",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
9848,on you and spoils you and doesn't really know you. I mean the feeling,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
9849,"that a very little child would have, who had been lost--for ever so",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
9850,long. It was a sense of getting home; of being clean and rested;,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
9851,"of safety and yet freedom; of love that was always there, warm like",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
9852,"sunshine in May, not hot like a stove or a featherbed--a love that",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"

9863,"for that Marvel of Celis's, but Terry had no such desire. He was crazy",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
9864,"to be out of it all. It made him sick, he said, SICK; this everlasting",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
9865,mother-mother-mothering. I don't think Terry had what the phrenologists,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"

9882,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
9883,"Come to think of it, I do not recall a similar case in all history or",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"

9885,they have killed the outrager; they have escaped; or they have,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
9886,submitted--sometimes seeming to get on very well with the victor,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"

9889,"threatened, as I remember, that if she did not submit he would slay her,",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
9890,slay a slave and place him beside her and say he found him there. A poor,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
9891,"device, it always seemed to me. If Mr. Lucretius had asked him how he",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
9892,"came to be in his wife's bedroom overlooking her morals, what could he",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"

9894,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"

9909,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
9910,"But he never did. She left our end of the country entirely, went up into",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"

9919,"course, but there was a great to-do all over the country about",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
9920,Ellador's leaving them. She had interviews with some of the leading,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
9921,"ethicists--wise women with still eyes, and with the best of the",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"

9923,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
9924,Our teaching about the rest of the world has given them all a sense,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
9925,"of isolation, of remoteness, of being a little outlying sample of a",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
9926,"country, overlooked and forgotten among the family of nations. We had",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
9927,"called it ""the family of nations,"" and they liked the phrase immensely.",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
9928,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
9929,"They were deeply aroused on the subject of evolution; indeed, the whole",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"

9933,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
9934,"We planned greatly about coming back, about establishing a connecting",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"

9939,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
9940,But meanwhile there was high council being held among the wisest of them,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
9941,all. The students and thinkers who had been gathering facts from us all,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"

9944,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
9945,Little had we thought that our careful efforts at concealment had been,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
9946,"so easily seen through, with never a word to show us that they saw. They",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
9947,"had followed up words of ours on the science of optics, asked innocent",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"

9950,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
9951,"With the lightest touch, different women asking different questions at",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
9952,"different times, and putting all our answers together like a picture",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
9953,"puzzle, they had figured out a sort of skeleton chart as to the",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
9954,prevalence of disease among us. Even more subtly with no show of horror,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
9955,"or condemnation, they had gathered something--far from the truth, but",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
9956,"something pretty clear--about poverty, vice, and crime. They even had",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
9957,"a goodly number of our dangers all itemized, from asking us about",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"

9962,divisions we had told them about. Never a shocked expression of the face,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
9963,or exclamation of revolt had warned us; they had been extracting the,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
9964,"evidence without our knowing it all this time, and now were studying",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
9965,with the most devout earnestness the matter they had prepared.,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
9966,,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
9967,The result was rather distressing to us. They first explained the matter,Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"
9968,"fully to Ellador, as she was the one who purposed visiting the Rest",Herland,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins"

10039,"education at St. Anthony's School, in Threadneedle Street, he was placed,",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10040,"as a boy, in the household of Cardinal John Morton, Archbishop of",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10041,Canterbury and Lord Chancellor.  It was not unusual for persons of wealth,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10042,or influence and sons of good families to be so established together in a,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10043,"relation of patron and client.  The youth wore his patron's livery, and",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10044,"added to his state.  The patron used, afterwards, his wealth or influence",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"

10046,been in earlier days that Bishop of Ely whom Richard III. sent to the,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"

10178,"and that spoke for the rest, was George Temse, the Provost of Casselsee:",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10179,both art and nature had concurred to make him eloquent: he was very,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"

10192,"perhaps, above one or two anywhere to be found, that is in all respects",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10193,"so perfect a friend: he is extraordinarily modest, there is no artifice",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"

10197,"my wife and children, which an absence of four months had quickened very",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10198,"much.  One day, as I was returning home from mass at St. Mary's, which is",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"

10201,"age; his face was tanned, he had a long beard, and his cloak was hanging",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10202,"carelessly about him, so that, by his looks and habit, I concluded he was",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10203,"a seaman.  As soon as Peter saw me, he came and saluted me, and as I was",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10204,"returning his civility, he took me aside, and pointing to him with whom",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10205,"he had been discoursing, he said, ""Do you see that man?  I was just",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10206,"thinking to bring him to you.""  I answered, ""He should have been very",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10207,"welcome on your account.""  ""And on his own too,"" replied he, ""if you knew",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"

10209,"unknown nations and countries as he can do, which I know you very much",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10210,"desire.""  ""Then,"" said I, ""I did not guess amiss, for at first sight I",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10211,"took him for a seaman.""  ""But you are much mistaken,"" said he, ""for he",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"

10215,"having applied himself more particularly to that than to the former,",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"

10217,"the Romans have left us nothing that is valuable, except what is to be",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10218,"found in Seneca and Cicero.  He is a Portuguese by birth, and was so",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10219,"desirous of seeing the world, that he divided his estate among his",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10220,"brothers, ran the same hazard as Americus Vesputius, and bore a share in",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10221,three of his four voyages that are now published; only he did not return,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10222,"with him in his last, but obtained leave of him, almost by force, that he",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10223,might be one of those twenty-four who were left at the farthest place at,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10224,which they touched in their last voyage to New Castile.  The leaving him,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10225,thus did not a little gratify one that was more fond of travelling than,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10226,of returning home to be buried in his own country; for he used often to,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10227,"say, that the way to heaven was the same from all places, and he that had",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10228,no grave had the heavens still over him.  Yet this disposition of mind,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10229,"had cost him dear, if God had not been very gracious to him; for after",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10230,"he, with five Castalians, had travelled over many countries, at last, by",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10231,"strange good fortune, he got to Ceylon, and from thence to Calicut, where",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10232,"he, very happily, found some Portuguese ships; and, beyond all men's",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10233,"expectations, returned to his native country.""  When Peter had said this",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10234,"to me, I thanked him for his kindness in intending to give me the",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10235,acquaintance of a man whose conversation he knew would be so acceptable;,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10236,and upon that Raphael and I embraced each other.  After those civilities,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10237,"were past which are usual with strangers upon their first meeting, we all",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10238,"went to my house, and entering into the garden, sat down on a green bank",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10239,and entertained one another in discourse.  He told us that when Vesputius,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10240,"had sailed away, he, and his companions that stayed behind in New",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10241,"Castile, by degrees insinuated themselves into the affections of the",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10242,"people of the country, meeting often with them and treating them gently;",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10243,"and at last they not only lived among them without danger, but conversed",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10244,"familiarly with them, and got so far into the heart of a prince, whose",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10245,"name and country I have forgot, that he both furnished them plentifully",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10246,"with all things necessary, and also with the conveniences of travelling,",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10247,"both boats when they went by water, and waggons when they travelled over",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10248,"land: he sent with them a very faithful guide, who was to introduce and",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10249,recommend them to such other princes as they had a mind to see: and after,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10250,"many days' journey, they came to towns, and cities, and to commonwealths,",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10251,"that were both happily governed and well peopled.  Under the equator, and",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10252,"as far on both sides of it as the sun moves, there lay vast deserts that",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10253,"were parched with the perpetual heat of the sun; the soil was withered,",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10254,"all things looked dismally, and all places were either quite uninhabited,",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10255,"or abounded with wild beasts and serpents, and some few men, that were",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10256,"neither less wild nor less cruel than the beasts themselves.  But, as",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10257,"they went farther, a new scene opened, all things grew milder, the air",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10258,"less burning, the soil more verdant, and even the beasts were less wild:",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10259,"and, at last, there were nations, towns, and cities, that had not only",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10260,"mutual commerce among themselves and with their neighbours, but traded,",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10261,"both by sea and land, to very remote countries.  There they found the",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10262,"conveniencies of seeing many countries on all hands, for no ship went any",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10263,voyage into which he and his companions were not very welcome.  The first,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10264,"vessels that they saw were flat-bottomed, their sails were made of reeds",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10265,"and wicker, woven close together, only some were of leather; but,",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10266,"afterwards, they found ships made with round keels and canvas sails, and",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10267,"in all respects like our ships, and the seamen understood both astronomy",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10268,and navigation.  He got wonderfully into their favour by showing them the,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10269,"use of the needle, of which till then they were utterly ignorant.  They",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10270,"sailed before with great caution, and only in summer time; but now they",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10271,"count all seasons alike, trusting wholly to the loadstone, in which they",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10272,"are, perhaps, more secure than safe; so that there is reason to fear that",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10273,"this discovery, which was thought would prove so much to their advantage,",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10274,"may, by their imprudence, become an occasion of much mischief to them.",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10275,But it were too long to dwell on all that he told us he had observed in,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10276,"every place, it would be too great a digression from our present purpose:",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10277,whatever is necessary to be told concerning those wise and prudent,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10278,"institutions which he observed among civilised nations, may perhaps be",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10279,related by us on a more proper occasion.  We asked him many questions,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10280,"concerning all these things, to which he answered very willingly; we made",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10281,"no inquiries after monsters, than which nothing is more common; for",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10282,"everywhere one may hear of ravenous dogs and wolves, and cruel",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10283,"men-eaters, but it is not so easy to find states that are well and wisely",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10284,governed.,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10285,,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10286,As he told us of many things that were amiss in those new-discovered,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10287,"countries, so he reckoned up not a few things, from which patterns might",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10288,be taken for correcting the errors of these nations among whom we live;,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10289,"of which an account may be given, as I have already promised, at some",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10290,"other time; for, at present, I intend only to relate those particulars",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10291,"that he told us, of the manners and laws of the Utopians: but I will",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10292,begin with the occasion that led us to speak of that commonwealth.  After,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10293,Raphael had discoursed with great judgment on the many errors that were,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10294,"both among us and these nations, had treated of the wise institutions",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10295,"both here and there, and had spoken as distinctly of the customs and",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10296,"government of every nation through which he had past, as if he had spent",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10297,"his whole life in it, Peter, being struck with admiration, said, ""I",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"

10304,"interest, and be of great use to all your friends.""  ""As for my friends,""",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10305,"answered he, ""I need not be much concerned, having already done for them",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10306,"all that was incumbent on me; for when I was not only in good health, but",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10307,"fresh and young, I distributed that among my kindred and friends which",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10308,other people do not part with till they are old and sick: when they then,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10309,unwillingly give that which they can enjoy no longer themselves.  I think,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10310,"my friends ought to rest contented with this, and not to expect that for",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10311,"their sakes I should enslave myself to any king whatsoever.""  ""Soft and",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10312,"fair!"" said Peter; ""I do not mean that you should be a slave to any king,",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10313,"but only that you should assist them and be useful to them.""  ""The change",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10314,"of the word,"" said he, ""does not alter the matter.""  ""But term it as you",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10315,"will,"" replied Peter, ""I do not see any other way in which you can be so",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10316,"useful, both in private to your friends and to the public, and by which",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10317,"you can make your own condition happier.""  ""Happier?"" answered Raphael,",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10318,"""is that to be compassed in a way so abhorrent to my genius?  Now I live",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10319,"as I will, to which I believe, few courtiers can pretend; and there are",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10320,"so many that court the favour of great men, that there will be no great",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10321,loss if they are not troubled either with me or with others of my,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10322,"temper.""  Upon this, said I, ""I perceive, Raphael, that you neither",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10323,"desire wealth nor greatness; and, indeed, I value and admire such a man",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10324,much more than I do any of the great men in the world.  Yet I think you,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10325,would do what would well become so generous and philosophical a soul as,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10326,"yours is, if you would apply your time and thoughts to public affairs,",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10327,even though you may happen to find it a little uneasy to yourself; and,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10328,this you can never do with so much advantage as by being taken into the,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10329,"council of some great prince and putting him on noble and worthy actions,",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10330,which I know you would do if you were in such a post; for the springs,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10331,"both of good and evil flow from the prince over a whole nation, as from a",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10332,"lasting fountain.  So much learning as you have, even without practice in",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10333,"affairs, or so great a practice as you have had, without any other",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10334,"learning, would render you a very fit counsellor to any king whatsoever.""",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10335,"""You are doubly mistaken,"" said he, ""Mr. More, both in your opinion of me",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10336,and in the judgment you make of things: for as I have not that capacity,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10337,"that you fancy I have, so if I had it, the public would not be one jot",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10338,the better when I had sacrificed my quiet to it.  For most princes apply,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10339,themselves more to affairs of war than to the useful arts of peace; and,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10340,"in these I neither have any knowledge, nor do I much desire it; they are",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10341,"generally more set on acquiring new kingdoms, right or wrong, than on",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10342,"governing well those they possess: and, among the ministers of princes,",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10343,"there are none that are not so wise as to need no assistance, or at",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10344,"least, that do not think themselves so wise that they imagine they need",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10345,"none; and if they court any, it is only those for whom the prince has",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10346,"much personal favour, whom by their fawning and flatteries they endeavour",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10347,"to fix to their own interests; and, indeed, nature has so made us, that",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10348,we all love to be flattered and to please ourselves with our own notions:,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10349,"the old crow loves his young, and the ape her cubs.  Now if in such a",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10350,"court, made up of persons who envy all others and only admire themselves,",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10351,a person should but propose anything that he had either read in history,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10352,"or observed in his travels, the rest would think that the reputation of",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10353,"their wisdom would sink, and that their interests would be much depressed",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10354,"if they could not run it down: and, if all other things failed, then they",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10355,"would fly to this, that such or such things pleased our ancestors, and it",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10356,were well for us if we could but match them.  They would set up their,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10357,"rest on such an answer, as a sufficient confutation of all that could be",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10358,"said, as if it were a great misfortune that any should be found wiser",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10359,than his ancestors.  But though they willingly let go all the good things,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10360,"that were among those of former ages, yet, if better things are proposed,",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10361,they cover themselves obstinately with this excuse of reverence to past,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10362,"times.  I have met with these proud, morose, and absurd judgments of",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10363,"things in many places, particularly once in England.""  ""Were you ever",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10364,"there?"" said I.  ""Yes, I was,"" answered he, ""and stayed some months",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10365,"there, not long after the rebellion in the West was suppressed, with a",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10366,great slaughter of the poor people that were engaged in it.,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10367,,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10368,"""I was then much obliged to that reverend prelate, John Morton,",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10369,"Archbishop of Canterbury, Cardinal, and Chancellor of England; a man,""",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10370,"said he, ""Peter (for Mr. More knows well what he was), that was not less",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10371,venerable for his wisdom and virtues than for the high character he bore:,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10372,"he was of a middle stature, not broken with age; his looks begot",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10373,"reverence rather than fear; his conversation was easy, but serious and",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10374,grave; he sometimes took pleasure to try the force of those that came as,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10375,"suitors to him upon business by speaking sharply, though decently, to",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10376,"them, and by that he discovered their spirit and presence of mind; with",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10377,"which he was much delighted when it did not grow up to impudence, as",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10378,"bearing a great resemblance to his own temper, and he looked on such",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10379,persons as the fittest men for affairs.  He spoke both gracefully and,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10380,"weightily; he was eminently skilled in the law, had a vast understanding,",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10381,and a prodigious memory; and those excellent talents with which nature,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10382,had furnished him were improved by study and experience.  When I was in,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10383,"England the King depended much on his counsels, and the Government seemed",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10384,to be chiefly supported by him; for from his youth he had been all along,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10385,"practised in affairs; and, having passed through many traverses of",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10386,"fortune, he had, with great cost, acquired a vast stock of wisdom, which",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10387,"is not soon lost when it is purchased so dear.  One day, when I was",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10388,"dining with him, there happened to be at table one of the English",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10389,"lawyers, who took occasion to run out in a high commendation of the",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10390,"severe execution of justice upon thieves, 'who,' as he said, 'were then",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10391,"hanged so fast that there were sometimes twenty on one gibbet!' and, upon",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10392,"that, he said, 'he could not wonder enough how it came to pass that,",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10393,"since so few escaped, there were yet so many thieves left, who were still",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10394,"robbing in all places.'  Upon this, I (who took the boldness to speak",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10395,"freely before the Cardinal) said, 'There was no reason to wonder at the",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10396,"matter, since this way of punishing thieves was neither just in itself",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10397,"nor good for the public; for, as the severity was too great, so the",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10398,remedy was not effectual; simple theft not being so great a crime that it,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10399,"ought to cost a man his life; no punishment, how severe soever, being",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10400,able to restrain those from robbing who can find out no other way of,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10401,"livelihood.  In this,' said I, 'not only you in England, but a great part",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10402,"of the world, imitate some ill masters, that are readier to chastise",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10403,their scholars than to teach them.  There are dreadful punishments,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10404,"enacted against thieves, but it were much better to make such good",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10405,"provisions by which every man might be put in a method how to live, and",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10406,so be preserved from the fatal necessity of stealing and of dying for,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10407,"it.'  'There has been care enough taken for that,' said he; 'there are",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10408,"many handicrafts, and there is husbandry, by which they may make a shift",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10409,"to live, unless they have a greater mind to follow ill courses.'  'That",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10410,"will not serve your turn,' said I, 'for many lose their limbs in civil or",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10411,"foreign wars, as lately in the Cornish rebellion, and some time ago in",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10412,"your wars with France, who, being thus mutilated in the service of their",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10413,"king and country, can no more follow their old trades, and are too old to",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10414,"learn new ones; but since wars are only accidental things, and have",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10415,"intervals, let us consider those things that fall out every day.  There",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10416,is a great number of noblemen among you that are themselves as idle as,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10417,"drones, that subsist on other men's labour, on the labour of their",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10418,"tenants, whom, to raise their revenues, they pare to the quick.  This,",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10419,"indeed, is the only instance of their frugality, for in all other things",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10420,"they are prodigal, even to the beggaring of themselves; but, besides",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10421,"this, they carry about with them a great number of idle fellows, who",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10422,"never learned any art by which they may gain their living; and these, as",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10423,"soon as either their lord dies, or they themselves fall sick, are turned",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10424,out of doors; for your lords are readier to feed idle people than to take,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10425,care of the sick; and often the heir is not able to keep together so,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10426,"great a family as his predecessor did.  Now, when the stomachs of those",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10427,"that are thus turned out of doors grow keen, they rob no less keenly; and",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10428,"what else can they do?  For when, by wandering about, they have worn out",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10429,"both their health and their clothes, and are tattered, and look ghastly,",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10430,"men of quality will not entertain them, and poor men dare not do it,",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10431,"knowing that one who has been bred up in idleness and pleasure, and who",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10432,"was used to walk about with his sword and buckler, despising all the",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10433,"neighbourhood with an insolent scorn as far below him, is not fit for the",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10434,spade and mattock; nor will he serve a poor man for so small a hire and,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10435,"in so low a diet as he can afford to give him.'  To this he answered,",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10436,"'This sort of men ought to be particularly cherished, for in them",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10437,consists the force of the armies for which we have occasion; since their,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10438,birth inspires them with a nobler sense of honour than is to be found,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10439,"among tradesmen or ploughmen.'  'You may as well say,' replied I, 'that",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10440,"you must cherish thieves on the account of wars, for you will never want",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10441,the one as long as you have the other; and as robbers prove sometimes,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10442,"gallant soldiers, so soldiers often prove brave robbers, so near an",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10443,"alliance there is between those two sorts of life.  But this bad custom,",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10444,"so common among you, of keeping many servants, is not peculiar to this",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10445,"nation.  In France there is yet a more pestiferous sort of people, for",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10446,"the whole country is full of soldiers, still kept up in time of peace (if",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10447,such a state of a nation can be called a peace); and these are kept in,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10448,pay upon the same account that you plead for those idle retainers about,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10449,"noblemen: this being a maxim of those pretended statesmen, that it is",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10450,necessary for the public safety to have a good body of veteran soldiers,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10451,"ever in readiness.  They think raw men are not to be depended on, and",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10452,"they sometimes seek occasions for making war, that they may train up",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10453,"their soldiers in the art of cutting throats, or, as Sallust observed,",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10454,"""for keeping their hands in use, that they may not grow dull by too long",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10455,"an intermission.""  But France has learned to its cost how dangerous it is",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10456,"to feed such beasts.  The fate of the Romans, Carthaginians, and Syrians,",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10457,"and many other nations and cities, which were both overturned and quite",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10458,"ruined by those standing armies, should make others wiser; and the folly",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10459,"of this maxim of the French appears plainly even from this, that their",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10460,"trained soldiers often find your raw men prove too hard for them, of",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10461,"which I will not say much, lest you may think I flatter the English.",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10462,Every day's experience shows that the mechanics in the towns or the,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10463,clowns in the country are not afraid of fighting with those idle,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10464,"gentlemen, if they are not disabled by some misfortune in their body or",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10465,dispirited by extreme want; so that you need not fear that those well-,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10466,shaped and strong men (for it is only such that noblemen love to keep,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10467,"about them till they spoil them), who now grow feeble with ease and are",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10468,"softened with their effeminate manner of life, would be less fit for",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10469,action if they were well bred and well employed.  And it seems very,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10470,"unreasonable that, for the prospect of a war, which you need never have",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10471,"but when you please, you should maintain so many idle men, as will always",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10472,"disturb you in time of peace, which is ever to be more considered than",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10473,war.  But I do not think that this necessity of stealing arises only from,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10474,"hence; there is another cause of it, more peculiar to England.'  'What is",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10475,"that?' said the Cardinal: 'The increase of pasture,' said I, 'by which",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10476,"your sheep, which are naturally mild, and easily kept in order, may be",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10477,"said now to devour men and unpeople, not only villages, but towns; for",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10478,wherever it is found that the sheep of any soil yield a softer and richer,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10479,"wool than ordinary, there the nobility and gentry, and even those holy",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10480,"men, the abbots! not contented with the old rents which their farms",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10481,"yielded, nor thinking it enough that they, living at their ease, do no",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10482,"good to the public, resolve to do it hurt instead of good.  They stop the",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10483,"course of agriculture, destroying houses and towns, reserving only the",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10484,"churches, and enclose grounds that they may lodge their sheep in them.  As",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10485,"if forests and parks had swallowed up too little of the land, those",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10486,worthy countrymen turn the best inhabited places into solitudes; for when,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10487,"an insatiable wretch, who is a plague to his country, resolves to enclose",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10488,"many thousand acres of ground, the owners, as well as tenants, are turned",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10489,"out of their possessions by trick or by main force, or, being wearied out",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10490,"by ill usage, they are forced to sell them; by which means those",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10491,"miserable people, both men and women, married and unmarried, old and",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10492,"young, with their poor but numerous families (since country business",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10493,"requires many hands), are all forced to change their seats, not knowing",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10494,"whither to go; and they must sell, almost for nothing, their household",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10495,"stuff, which could not bring them much money, even though they might stay",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10496,for a buyer.  When that little money is at an end (for it will be soon,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10497,"spent), what is left for them to do but either to steal, and so to be",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10498,"hanged (God knows how justly!), or to go about and beg? and if they do",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10499,"this they are put in prison as idle vagabonds, while they would willingly",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10500,work but can find none that will hire them; for there is no more occasion,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10501,"for country labour, to which they have been bred, when there is no arable",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10502,"ground left.  One shepherd can look after a flock, which will stock an",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10503,extent of ground that would require many hands if it were to be ploughed,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10504,"and reaped.  This, likewise, in many places raises the price of corn.  The",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10505,"price of wool is also so risen that the poor people, who were wont to",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10506,"make cloth, are no more able to buy it; and this, likewise, makes many of",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10507,them idle: for since the increase of pasture God has punished the avarice,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10508,"of the owners by a rot among the sheep, which has destroyed vast numbers",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10509,of them--to us it might have seemed more just had it fell on the owners,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10510,"themselves.  But, suppose the sheep should increase ever so much, their",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10511,"price is not likely to fall; since, though they cannot be called a",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10512,"monopoly, because they are not engrossed by one person, yet they are in",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10513,"so few hands, and these are so rich, that, as they are not pressed to",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10514,"sell them sooner than they have a mind to it, so they never do it till",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10515,they have raised the price as high as possible.  And on the same account,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10516,"it is that the other kinds of cattle are so dear, because many villages",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10517,"being pulled down, and all country labour being much neglected, there are",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10518,none who make it their business to breed them.  The rich do not breed,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10519,"cattle as they do sheep, but buy them lean and at low prices; and, after",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10520,"they have fattened them on their grounds, sell them again at high rates.",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10521,And I do not think that all the inconveniences this will produce are yet,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10522,"observed; for, as they sell the cattle dear, so, if they are consumed",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10523,faster than the breeding countries from which they are brought can afford,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10524,"them, then the stock must decrease, and this must needs end in great",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10525,"scarcity; and by these means, this your island, which seemed as to this",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10526,"particular the happiest in the world, will suffer much by the cursed",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10527,"avarice of a few persons: besides this, the rising of corn makes all",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10528,people lessen their families as much as they can; and what can those who,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10529,are dismissed by them do but either beg or rob?  And to this last a man,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10530,of a great mind is much sooner drawn than to the former.  Luxury likewise,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10531,breaks in apace upon you to set forward your poverty and misery; there is,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10532,"an excessive vanity in apparel, and great cost in diet, and that not only",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10533,"in noblemen's families, but even among tradesmen, among the farmers",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10534,"themselves, and among all ranks of persons.  You have also many infamous",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"

10539,"Banish these plagues, and give orders that those who have dispeopled so",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10540,much soil may either rebuild the villages they have pulled down or let,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10541,out their grounds to such as will do it; restrain those engrossings of,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10542,"the rich, that are as bad almost as monopolies; leave fewer occasions to",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10543,"idleness; let agriculture be set up again, and the manufacture of the",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10544,"wool be regulated, that so there may be work found for those companies of",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10545,"idle people whom want forces to be thieves, or who now, being idle",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10546,"vagabonds or useless servants, will certainly grow thieves at last.  If",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10547,you do not find a remedy to these evils it is a vain thing to boast of,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10548,"your severity in punishing theft, which, though it may have the",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10549,"appearance of justice, yet in itself is neither just nor convenient; for",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10550,"if you suffer your people to be ill-educated, and their manners to be",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10551,"corrupted from their infancy, and then punish them for those crimes to",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10552,"which their first education disposed them, what else is to be concluded",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10553,from this but that you first make thieves and then punish them?',Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10554,,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10555,"""While I was talking thus, the Counsellor, who was present, had prepared",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10556,"an answer, and had resolved to resume all I had said, according to the",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10557,"formality of a debate, in which things are generally repeated more",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10558,"faithfully than they are answered, as if the chief trial to be made were",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10559,"of men's memories.  'You have talked prettily, for a stranger,' said he,",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10560,'having heard of many things among us which you have not been able to,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10561,"consider well; but I will make the whole matter plain to you, and will",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10562,first repeat in order all that you have said; then I will show how much,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10563,"your ignorance of our affairs has misled you; and will, in the last",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10564,"place, answer all your arguments.  And, that I may begin where I",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10565,"promised, there were four things--'  'Hold your peace!' said the",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10566,"Cardinal; 'this will take up too much time; therefore we will, at",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10567,"present, ease you of the trouble of answering, and reserve it to our next",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10568,"meeting, which shall be to-morrow, if Raphael's affairs and yours can",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10569,"admit of it.  But, Raphael,' said he to me, 'I would gladly know upon",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10570,what reason it is that you think theft ought not to be punished by death:,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10571,would you give way to it? or do you propose any other punishment that,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10572,"will be more useful to the public? for, since death does not restrain",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10573,"theft, if men thought their lives would be safe, what fear or force could",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10574,"restrain ill men?  On the contrary, they would look on the mitigation of",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10575,"the punishment as an invitation to commit more crimes.'  I answered, 'It",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10576,seems to me a very unjust thing to take away a man's life for a little,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10577,"money, for nothing in the world can be of equal value with a man's life:",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10578,"and if it be said, ""that it is not for the money that one suffers, but",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10579,"for his breaking the law,"" I must say, extreme justice is an extreme",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10580,injury: for we ought not to approve of those terrible laws that make the,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10581,"smallest offences capital, nor of that opinion of the Stoics that makes",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10582,all crimes equal; as if there were no difference to be made between the,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10583,"killing a man and the taking his purse, between which, if we examine",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10584,"things impartially, there is no likeness nor proportion.  God has",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10585,"commanded us not to kill, and shall we kill so easily for a little money?",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10586,"But if one shall say, that by that law we are only forbid to kill any",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10587,"except when the laws of the land allow of it, upon the same grounds, laws",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10588,"may be made, in some cases, to allow of adultery and perjury: for God",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10589,having taken from us the right of disposing either of our own or of other,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10590,"people's lives, if it is pretended that the mutual consent of men in",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10591,making laws can authorise man-slaughter in cases in which God has given,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10592,"us no example, that it frees people from the obligation of the divine",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10593,"law, and so makes murder a lawful action, what is this, but to give a",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10594,"preference to human laws before the divine? and, if this is once",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10595,"admitted, by the same rule men may, in all other things, put what",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10596,"restrictions they please upon the laws of God.  If, by the Mosaical law,",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10597,"though it was rough and severe, as being a yoke laid on an obstinate and",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10598,"servile nation, men were only fined, and not put to death for theft, we",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10599,"cannot imagine, that in this new law of mercy, in which God treats us",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10600,"with the tenderness of a father, He has given us a greater licence to",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10601,"cruelty than He did to the Jews.  Upon these reasons it is, that I think",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10602,putting thieves to death is not lawful; and it is plain and obvious that,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10603,it is absurd and of ill consequence to the commonwealth that a thief and,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10604,a murderer should be equally punished; for if a robber sees that his,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10605,danger is the same if he is convicted of theft as if he were guilty of,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10606,"murder, this will naturally incite him to kill the person whom otherwise",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10607,"he would only have robbed; since, if the punishment is the same, there is",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10608,"more security, and less danger of discovery, when he that can best make",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10609,it is put out of the way; so that terrifying thieves too much provokes,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10610,them to cruelty.,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10611,,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10612,"""But as to the question, 'What more convenient way of punishment can be",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10613,found?' I think it much easier to find out that than to invent anything,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10614,that is worse; why should we doubt but the way that was so long in use,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10615,"among the old Romans, who understood so well the arts of government, was",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10616,very proper for their punishment?  They condemned such as they found,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10617,"guilty of great crimes to work their whole lives in quarries, or to dig",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10618,in mines with chains about them.  But the method that I liked best was,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10619,"that which I observed in my travels in Persia, among the Polylerits, who",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10620,are a considerable and well-governed people: they pay a yearly tribute to,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10621,"the King of Persia, but in all other respects they are a free nation, and",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10622,"governed by their own laws: they lie far from the sea, and are environed",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10623,"with hills; and, being contented with the productions of their own",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10624,"country, which is very fruitful, they have little commerce with any other",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10625,"nation; and as they, according to the genius of their country, have no",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10626,"inclination to enlarge their borders, so their mountains and the pension",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10627,"they pay to the Persian, secure them from all invasions.  Thus they have",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10628,"no wars among them; they live rather conveniently than with splendour,",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10629,and may be rather called a happy nation than either eminent or famous;,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10630,"for I do not think that they are known, so much as by name, to any but",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10631,their next neighbours.  Those that are found guilty of theft among them,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10632,"are bound to make restitution to the owner, and not, as it is in other",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10633,"places, to the prince, for they reckon that the prince has no more right",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10634,to the stolen goods than the thief; but if that which was stolen is no,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10635,"more in being, then the goods of the thieves are estimated, and",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10636,"restitution being made out of them, the remainder is given to their wives",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10637,and children; and they themselves are condemned to serve in the public,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10638,"works, but are neither imprisoned nor chained, unless there happens to be",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10639,some extraordinary circumstance in their crimes.  They go about loose and,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10640,"free, working for the public: if they are idle or backward to work they",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10641,"are whipped, but if they work hard they are well used and treated without",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10642,"any mark of reproach; only the lists of them are called always at night,",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10643,and then they are shut up.  They suffer no other uneasiness but this of,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10644,"constant labour; for, as they work for the public, so they are well",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10645,"entertained out of the public stock, which is done differently in",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10646,different places: in some places whatever is bestowed on them is raised,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10647,"by a charitable contribution; and, though this way may seem uncertain,",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10648,"yet so merciful are the inclinations of that people, that they are",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10649,plentifully supplied by it; but in other places public revenues are set,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10650,"aside for them, or there is a constant tax or poll-money raised for their",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10651,"maintenance.  In some places they are set to no public work, but every",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10652,private man that has occasion to hire workmen goes to the market-places,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10653,"and hires them of the public, a little lower than he would do a freeman.",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10654,If they go lazily about their task he may quicken them with the whip.  By,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10655,this means there is always some piece of work or other to be done by,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10656,"them; and, besides their livelihood, they earn somewhat still to the",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10657,"public.  They all wear a peculiar habit, of one certain colour, and their",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10658,"hair is cropped a little above their ears, and a piece of one of their",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10659,"ears is cut off.  Their friends are allowed to give them either meat,",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10660,"drink, or clothes, so they are of their proper colour; but it is death,",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10661,"both to the giver and taker, if they give them money; nor is it less",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10662,penal for any freeman to take money from them upon any account,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10663,whatsoever: and it is also death for any of these slaves (so they are,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10664,called) to handle arms.  Those of every division of the country are,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10665,"distinguished by a peculiar mark, which it is capital for them to lay",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10666,"aside, to go out of their bounds, or to talk with a slave of another",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10667,"jurisdiction, and the very attempt of an escape is no less penal than an",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10668,escape itself.  It is death for any other slave to be accessory to it;,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10669,and if a freeman engages in it he is condemned to slavery.  Those that,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10670,"discover it are rewarded--if freemen, in money; and if slaves, with",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10671,"liberty, together with a pardon for being accessory to it; that so they",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10672,might find their account rather in repenting of their engaging in such a,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10673,design than in persisting in it.,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10674,,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10675,"""These are their laws and rules in relation to robbery, and it is obvious",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10676,that they are as advantageous as they are mild and gentle; since vice is,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10677,"not only destroyed and men preserved, but they are treated in such a",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10678,manner as to make them see the necessity of being honest and of employing,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10679,the rest of their lives in repairing the injuries they had formerly done,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10680,to society.  Nor is there any hazard of their falling back to their old,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10681,customs; and so little do travellers apprehend mischief from them that,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10682,they generally make use of them for guides from one jurisdiction to,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10683,another; for there is nothing left them by which they can rob or be the,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10684,"better for it, since, as they are disarmed, so the very having of money",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10685,is a sufficient conviction: and as they are certainly punished if,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10686,"discovered, so they cannot hope to escape; for their habit being in all",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10687,"the parts of it different from what is commonly worn, they cannot fly",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10688,"away, unless they would go naked, and even then their cropped ear would",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10689,betray them.  The only danger to be feared from them is their conspiring,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10690,against the government; but those of one division and neighbourhood can,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10691,do nothing to any purpose unless a general conspiracy were laid amongst,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10692,"all the slaves of the several jurisdictions, which cannot be done, since",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10693,they cannot meet or talk together; nor will any venture on a design where,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10694,the concealment would be so dangerous and the discovery so profitable.,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10695,"None are quite hopeless of recovering their freedom, since by their",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10696,"obedience and patience, and by giving good grounds to believe that they",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10697,"will change their manner of life for the future, they may expect at last",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10698,"to obtain their liberty, and some are every year restored to it upon the",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10699,"good character that is given of them.  When I had related all this, I",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10700,added that I did not see why such a method might not be followed with,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10701,more advantage than could ever be expected from that severe justice which,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10702,"the Counsellor magnified so much.  To this he answered, 'That it could",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10703,never take place in England without endangering the whole nation.'  As he,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10704,"said this he shook his head, made some grimaces, and held his peace,",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10705,"while all the company seemed of his opinion, except the Cardinal, who",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10706,"said, 'That it was not easy to form a judgment of its success, since it",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10707,"was a method that never yet had been tried; but if,' said he, 'when",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10708,"sentence of death were passed upon a thief, the prince would reprieve him",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10709,"for a while, and make the experiment upon him, denying him the privilege",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10710,"of a sanctuary; and then, if it had a good effect upon him, it might take",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10711,"place; and, if it did not succeed, the worst would be to execute the",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10712,"sentence on the condemned persons at last; and I do not see,' added he,",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10713,"'why it would be either unjust, inconvenient, or at all dangerous to",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10714,admit of such a delay; in my opinion the vagabonds ought to be treated in,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10715,"the same manner, against whom, though we have made many laws, yet we have",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10716,"not been able to gain our end.'  When the Cardinal had done, they all",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10717,"commended the motion, though they had despised it when it came from me,",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10718,"but more particularly commended what related to the vagabonds, because it",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10719,was his own observation.,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10720,,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10721,"""I do not know whether it be worth while to tell what followed, for it",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10722,"was very ridiculous; but I shall venture at it, for as it is not foreign",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10723,"to this matter, so some good use may be made of it.  There was a Jester",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10724,"standing by, that counterfeited the fool so naturally that he seemed to",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10725,be really one; the jests which he offered were so cold and dull that we,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10726,"laughed more at him than at them, yet sometimes he said, as it were by",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10727,"chance, things that were not unpleasant, so as to justify the old",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10728,"proverb, 'That he who throws the dice often, will sometimes have a lucky",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10729,hit.'  When one of the company had said that I had taken care of the,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10730,"thieves, and the Cardinal had taken care of the vagabonds, so that there",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10731,remained nothing but that some public provision might be made for the,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10732,"poor whom sickness or old age had disabled from labour, 'Leave that to",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10733,"me,' said the Fool, 'and I shall take care of them, for there is no sort",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10734,"of people whose sight I abhor more, having been so often vexed with them",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10735,and with their sad complaints; but as dolefully soever as they have told,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10736,"their tale, they could never prevail so far as to draw one penny from me;",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10737,"for either I had no mind to give them anything, or, when I had a mind to",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10738,"do it, I had nothing to give them; and they now know me so well that they",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10739,"will not lose their labour, but let me pass without giving me any",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10740,"trouble, because they hope for nothing--no more, in faith, than if I were",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10741,a priest; but I would have a law made for sending all these beggars to,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10742,"monasteries, the men to the Benedictines, to be made lay-brothers, and",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10743,"the women to be nuns.'  The Cardinal smiled, and approved of it in jest,",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10744,"but the rest liked it in earnest.  There was a divine present, who,",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10745,"though he was a grave morose man, yet he was so pleased with this",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10746,reflection that was made on the priests and the monks that he began to,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10747,"play with the Fool, and said to him, 'This will not deliver you from all",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10748,"beggars, except you take care of us Friars.'  'That is done already,'",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10749,"answered the Fool, 'for the Cardinal has provided for you by what he",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10750,"proposed for restraining vagabonds and setting them to work, for I know",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10751,"no vagabonds like you.'  This was well entertained by the whole company,",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10752,"who, looking at the Cardinal, perceived that he was not ill-pleased at",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10753,"it; only the Friar himself was vexed, as may be easily imagined, and fell",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10754,"into such a passion that he could not forbear railing at the Fool, and",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10755,"calling him knave, slanderer, backbiter, and son of perdition, and then",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10756,cited some dreadful threatenings out of the Scriptures against him.  Now,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10757,"the Jester thought he was in his element, and laid about him freely.",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10758,"'Good Friar,' said he, 'be not angry, for it is written, ""In patience",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10759,"possess your soul.""'  The Friar answered (for I shall give you his own",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10760,"words), 'I am not angry, you hangman; at least, I do not sin in it, for",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10761,"the Psalmist says, ""Be ye angry and sin not.""'  Upon this the Cardinal",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10762,"admonished him gently, and wished him to govern his passions.  'No, my",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10763,"lord,' said he, 'I speak not but from a good zeal, which I ought to have,",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10764,"for holy men have had a good zeal, as it is said, ""The zeal of thy house",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10765,"hath eaten me up;"" and we sing in our church that those who mocked Elisha",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10766,"as he went up to the house of God felt the effects of his zeal, which",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10767,"that mocker, that rogue, that scoundrel, will perhaps feel.'  'You do",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10768,"this, perhaps, with a good intention,' said the Cardinal, 'but, in my",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10769,"opinion, it were wiser in you, and perhaps better for you, not to engage",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10770,"in so ridiculous a contest with a Fool.'  'No, my lord,' answered he,",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"

10784,observed you to hearken to it as if you had no mind to lose any part of,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"

10802,"great deal of good to mankind, and this is the chief design that every",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10803,good man ought to propose to himself in living; for your friend Plato,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10804,thinks that nations will be happy when either philosophers become kings,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10805,or kings become philosophers.  It is no wonder if we are so far from that,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"

10818,"be laughed at for my pains?  For instance, what could I signify if I were",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10819,"about the King of France, and were called into his cabinet council, where",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"

10821,"what arts and practices Milan may be kept, and Naples, that has so often",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10822,"slipped out of their hands, recovered; how the Venetians, and after them",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"

10824,"all Burgundy, and some other kingdoms which he has swallowed already in",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10825,"his designs, may be added to his empire?  One proposes a league with the",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10826,"Venetians, to be kept as long as he finds his account in it, and that he",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10827,"ought to communicate counsels with them, and give them some share of the",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10828,"spoil till his success makes him need or fear them less, and then it will",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10829,be easily taken out of their hands; another proposes the hiring the,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10830,Germans and the securing the Switzers by pensions; another proposes the,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10831,"gaining the Emperor by money, which is omnipotent with him; another",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10832,"proposes a peace with the King of Arragon, and, in order to cement it,",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10833,the yielding up the King of Navarre's pretensions; another thinks that,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10834,"the Prince of Castile is to be wrought on by the hope of an alliance, and",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10835,that some of his courtiers are to be gained to the French faction by,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10836,"pensions.  The hardest point of all is, what to do with England; a treaty",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10837,"of peace is to be set on foot, and, if their alliance is not to be",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10838,"depended on, yet it is to be made as firm as possible, and they are to be",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10839,"called friends, but suspected as enemies: therefore the Scots are to be",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10840,kept in readiness to be let loose upon England on every occasion; and,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10841,some banished nobleman is to be supported underhand (for by the League it,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10842,"cannot be done avowedly) who has a pretension to the crown, by which",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10843,means that suspected prince may be kept in awe.  Now when things are in,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10844,"so great a fermentation, and so many gallant men are joining counsels how",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10845,"to carry on the war, if so mean a man as I should stand up and wish them",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10846,"to change all their counsels--to let Italy alone and stay at home, since",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10847,the kingdom of France was indeed greater than could be well governed by,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10848,one man; that therefore he ought not to think of adding others to it; and,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10849,"if, after this, I should propose to them the resolutions of the",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10850,"Achorians, a people that lie on the south-east of Utopia, who long ago",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10851,engaged in war in order to add to the dominions of their prince another,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10852,"kingdom, to which he had some pretensions by an ancient alliance: this",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10853,"they conquered, but found that the trouble of keeping it was equal to",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10854,that by which it was gained; that the conquered people were always either,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10855,"in rebellion or exposed to foreign invasions, while they were obliged to",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10856,"be incessantly at war, either for or against them, and consequently could",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10857,never disband their army; that in the meantime they were oppressed with,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10858,"taxes, their money went out of the kingdom, their blood was spilt for the",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10859,"glory of their king without procuring the least advantage to the people,",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10860,who received not the smallest benefit from it even in time of peace; and,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10861,"that, their manners being corrupted by a long war, robbery and murders",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10862,"everywhere abounded, and their laws fell into contempt; while their king,",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10863,"distracted with the care of two kingdoms, was the less able to apply his",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10864,"mind to the interest of either.  When they saw this, and that there would",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10865,"be no end to these evils, they by joint counsels made an humble address",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10866,"to their king, desiring him to choose which of the two kingdoms he had",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10867,"the greatest mind to keep, since he could not hold both; for they were",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10868,"too great a people to be governed by a divided king, since no man would",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10869,willingly have a groom that should be in common between him and another.,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10870,Upon which the good prince was forced to quit his new kingdom to one of,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10871,"his friends (who was not long after dethroned), and to be contented with",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10872,"his old one.  To this I would add that after all those warlike attempts,",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10873,"the vast confusions, and the consumption both of treasure and of people",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10874,"that must follow them, perhaps upon some misfortune they might be forced",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10875,to throw up all at last; therefore it seemed much more eligible that the,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10876,"king should improve his ancient kingdom all he could, and make it",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10877,"flourish as much as possible; that he should love his people, and be",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10878,"beloved of them; that he should live among them, govern them gently and",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10879,"let other kingdoms alone, since that which had fallen to his share was",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10880,"big enough, if not too big, for him:--pray, how do you think would such a",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10881,"speech as this be heard?""",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10882,,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10883,"""I confess,"" said I, ""I think not very well.""",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10884,,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10885,"""But what,"" said he, ""if I should sort with another kind of ministers,",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10886,whose chief contrivances and consultations were by what art the prince's,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10887,treasures might be increased? where one proposes raising the value of,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10888,"specie when the king's debts are large, and lowering it when his revenues",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10889,"were to come in, that so he might both pay much with a little, and in a",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10890,"little receive a great deal.  Another proposes a pretence of a war, that",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10891,"money might be raised in order to carry it on, and that a peace be",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10892,concluded as soon as that was done; and this with such appearances of,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10893,"religion as might work on the people, and make them impute it to the",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10894,"piety of their prince, and to his tenderness for the lives of his",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10895,subjects.  A third offers some old musty laws that have been antiquated,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10896,"by a long disuse (and which, as they had been forgotten by all the",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10897,"subjects, so they had also been broken by them), and proposes the levying",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10898,"the penalties of these laws, that, as it would bring in a vast treasure,",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10899,"so there might be a very good pretence for it, since it would look like",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10900,the executing a law and the doing of justice.  A fourth proposes the,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10901,"prohibiting of many things under severe penalties, especially such as",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10902,"were against the interest of the people, and then the dispensing with",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10903,"these prohibitions, upon great compositions, to those who might find",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10904,"their advantage in breaking them.  This would serve two ends, both of",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10905,them acceptable to many; for as those whose avarice led them to,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10906,"transgress would be severely fined, so the selling licences dear would",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10907,"look as if a prince were tender of his people, and would not easily, or",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10908,"at low rates, dispense with anything that might be against the public",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10909,"good.  Another proposes that the judges must be made sure, that they may",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10910,declare always in favour of the prerogative; that they must be often sent,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10911,"for to court, that the king may hear them argue those points in which he",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10912,"is concerned; since, how unjust soever any of his pretensions may be, yet",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10913,"still some one or other of them, either out of contradiction to others,",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10914,"or the pride of singularity, or to make their court, would find out some",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10915,pretence or other to give the king a fair colour to carry the point.  For,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10916,"if the judges but differ in opinion, the clearest thing in the world is",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10917,"made by that means disputable, and truth being once brought in question,",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10918,the king may then take advantage to expound the law for his own profit;,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10919,"while the judges that stand out will be brought over, either through fear",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10920,"or modesty; and they being thus gained, all of them may be sent to the",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10921,Bench to give sentence boldly as the king would have it; for fair,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10922,pretences will never be wanting when sentence is to be given in the,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10923,"prince's favour.  It will either be said that equity lies of his side, or",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10924,"some words in the law will be found sounding that way, or some forced",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10925,"sense will be put on them; and, when all other things fail, the king's",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10926,"undoubted prerogative will be pretended, as that which is above all law,",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10927,and to which a religious judge ought to have a special regard.  Thus all,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10928,"consent to that maxim of Crassus, that a prince cannot have treasure",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10929,"enough, since he must maintain his armies out of it; that a king, even",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10930,"though he would, can do nothing unjustly; that all property is in him,",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10931,not excepting the very persons of his subjects; and that no man has any,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10932,"other property but that which the king, out of his goodness, thinks fit",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10933,to leave him.  And they think it is the prince's interest that there be,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10934,"as little of this left as may be, as if it were his advantage that his",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10935,"people should have neither riches nor liberty, since these things make",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10936,them less easy and willing to submit to a cruel and unjust government.,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10937,"Whereas necessity and poverty blunts them, makes them patient, beats them",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10938,"down, and breaks that height of spirit that might otherwise dispose them",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10939,"to rebel.  Now what if, after all these propositions were made, I should",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10940,rise up and assert that such counsels were both unbecoming a king and,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10941,"mischievous to him; and that not only his honour, but his safety,",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10942,consisted more in his people's wealth than in his own; if I should show,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10943,"that they choose a king for their own sake, and not for his; that, by his",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10944,"care and endeavours, they may be both easy and safe; and that, therefore,",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10945,a prince ought to take more care of his people's happiness than of his,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10946,"own, as a shepherd is to take more care of his flock than of himself?  It",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10947,is also certain that they are much mistaken that think the poverty of a,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10948,nation is a mean of the public safety.  Who quarrel more than beggars?,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10949,who does more earnestly long for a change than he that is uneasy in his,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10950,present circumstances? and who run to create confusions with so desperate,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10951,"a boldness as those who, having nothing to lose, hope to gain by them?  If",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10952,a king should fall under such contempt or envy that he could not keep his,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10953,"subjects in their duty but by oppression and ill usage, and by rendering",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10954,"them poor and miserable, it were certainly better for him to quit his",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10955,"kingdom than to retain it by such methods as make him, while he keeps the",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10956,"name of authority, lose the majesty due to it.  Nor is it so becoming the",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10957,dignity of a king to reign over beggars as over rich and happy subjects.,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10958,"And therefore Fabricius, a man of a noble and exalted temper, said 'he",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10959,would rather govern rich men than be rich himself; since for one man to,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10960,abound in wealth and pleasure when all about him are mourning and,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10961,"groaning, is to be a gaoler and not a king.'  He is an unskilful",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10962,physician that cannot cure one disease without casting his patient into,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10963,another.  So he that can find no other way for correcting the errors of,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10964,"his people but by taking from them the conveniences of life, shows that",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10965,he knows not what it is to govern a free nation.  He himself ought rather,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10966,"to shake off his sloth, or to lay down his pride, for the contempt or",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10967,hatred that his people have for him takes its rise from the vices in,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10968,"himself.  Let him live upon what belongs to him without wronging others,",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10969,"and accommodate his expense to his revenue.  Let him punish crimes, and,",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10970,"by his wise conduct, let him endeavour to prevent them, rather than be",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10971,severe when he has suffered them to be too common.  Let him not rashly,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10972,"revive laws that are abrogated by disuse, especially if they have been",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10973,long forgotten and never wanted.  And let him never take any penalty for,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10974,"the breach of them to which a judge would not give way in a private man,",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10975,but would look on him as a crafty and unjust person for pretending to it.,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10976,To these things I would add that law among the Macarians--a people that,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10977,"live not far from Utopia--by which their king, on the day on which he",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10978,"began to reign, is tied by an oath, confirmed by solemn sacrifices, never",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10979,"to have at once above a thousand pounds of gold in his treasures, or so",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10980,"much silver as is equal to that in value.  This law, they tell us, was",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10981,made by an excellent king who had more regard to the riches of his,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10982,"country than to his own wealth, and therefore provided against the",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10983,heaping up of so much treasure as might impoverish the people.  He,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10984,"thought that moderate sum might be sufficient for any accident, if either",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10985,"the king had occasion for it against the rebels, or the kingdom against",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10986,the invasion of an enemy; but that it was not enough to encourage a,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10987,prince to invade other men's rights--a circumstance that was the chief,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10988,cause of his making that law.  He also thought that it was a good,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10989,provision for that free circulation of money so necessary for the course,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10990,of commerce and exchange.  And when a king must distribute all those,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10991,"extraordinary accessions that increase treasure beyond the due pitch, it",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
10992,makes him less disposed to oppress his subjects.  Such a king as this,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"

11107,foresee that the setting all upon a level was the only way to make a,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"

11109,"when every man draws to himself all that he can compass, by one title or",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"

11121,"that lie on a great part of mankind may be made lighter, but they can",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
11122,never be quite removed; for if laws were made to determine at how great,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
11123,"an extent in soil, and at how much money, every man must stop--to limit",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
11124,"the prince, that he might not grow too great; and to restrain the people,",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
11125,that they might not become too insolent--and that none might factiously,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
11126,"aspire to public employments, which ought neither to be sold nor made",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
11127,"burdensome by a great expense, since otherwise those that serve in them",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
11128,"would be tempted to reimburse themselves by cheats and violence, and it",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
11129,would become necessary to find out rich men for undergoing those,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
11130,"employments, which ought rather to be trusted to the wise.  These laws, I",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
11131,"say, might have such effect as good diet and care might have on a sick",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
11132,man whose recovery is desperate; they might allay and mitigate the,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"

11170,mentions a shipwreck that was made on their coast twelve hundred years,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
11171,"ago, and that some Romans and Egyptians that were in the ship, getting",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
11172,"safe ashore, spent the rest of their days amongst them; and such was",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
11173,their ingenuity that from this single opportunity they drew the advantage,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
11174,"of learning from those unlooked-for guests, and acquired all the useful",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
11175,"arts that were then among the Romans, and which were known to these",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
11176,shipwrecked men; and by the hints that they gave them they themselves,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
11177,"found out even some of those arts which they could not fully explain, so",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
11178,happily did they improve that accident of having some of our people cast,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
11179,upon their shore.  But if such an accident has at any time brought any,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
11180,"from thence into Europe, we have been so far from improving it that we do",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
11181,"not so much as remember it, as, in aftertimes perhaps, it will be forgot",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"

11203,"""The island of Utopia is in the middle two hundred miles broad, and holds",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
11204,"almost at the same breadth over a great part of it, but it grows narrower",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
11205,towards both ends.  Its figure is not unlike a crescent.  Between its,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
11206,"horns the sea comes in eleven miles broad, and spreads itself into a",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
11207,"great bay, which is environed with land to the compass of about five",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
11208,"hundred miles, and is well secured from winds.  In this bay there is no",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
11209,"great current; the whole coast is, as it were, one continued harbour,",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
11210,which gives all that live in the island great convenience for mutual,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
11211,"commerce.  But the entry into the bay, occasioned by rocks on the one",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
11212,"hand and shallows on the other, is very dangerous.  In the middle of it",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
11213,"there is one single rock which appears above water, and may, therefore,",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
11214,"easily be avoided; and on the top of it there is a tower, in which a",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
11215,"garrison is kept; the other rocks lie under water, and are very",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
11216,dangerous.  The channel is known only to the natives; so that if any,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
11217,stranger should enter into the bay without one of their pilots he would,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
11218,run great danger of shipwreck.  For even they themselves could not pass,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
11219,it safe if some marks that are on the coast did not direct their way; and,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
11220,"if these should be but a little shifted, any fleet that might come",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
11221,"against them, how great soever it were, would be certainly lost.  On the",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
11222,other side of the island there are likewise many harbours; and the coast,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
11223,"is so fortified, both by nature and art, that a small number of men can",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
11224,hinder the descent of a great army.  But they report (and there remains,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
11225,"good marks of it to make it credible) that this was no island at first,",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
11226,"but a part of the continent.  Utopus, that conquered it (whose name it",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
11227,"still carries, for Abraxa was its first name), brought the rude and",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
11228,"uncivilised inhabitants into such a good government, and to that measure",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
11229,"of politeness, that they now far excel all the rest of mankind.  Having",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
11230,"soon subdued them, he designed to separate them from the continent, and",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
11231,to bring the sea quite round them.  To accomplish this he ordered a deep,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
11232,"channel to be dug, fifteen miles long; and that the natives might not",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
11233,"think he treated them like slaves, he not only forced the inhabitants,",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
11234,"but also his own soldiers, to labour in carrying it on.  As he set a vast",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
11235,"number of men to work, he, beyond all men's expectations, brought it to a",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
11236,"speedy conclusion.  And his neighbours, who at first laughed at the folly",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
11237,"of the undertaking, no sooner saw it brought to perfection than they were",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"

11250,"least twenty miles, and, where the towns lie wider, they have much more",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
11251,"ground.  No town desires to enlarge its bounds, for the people consider",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
11252,"themselves rather as tenants than landlords.  They have built, over all",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
11253,"the country, farmhouses for husbandmen, which are well contrived, and",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
11254,furnished with all things necessary for country labour.  Inhabitants are,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
11255,"sent, by turns, from the cities to dwell in them; no country family has",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
11256,"fewer than forty men and women in it, besides two slaves.  There is a",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
11257,"master and a mistress set over every family, and over thirty families",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
11258,there is a magistrate.  Every year twenty of this family come back to the,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
11259,"town after they have stayed two years in the country, and in their room",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
11260,"there are other twenty sent from the town, that they may learn country",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
11261,"work from those that have been already one year in the country, as they",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
11262,must teach those that come to them the next from the town.  By this means,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
11263,"such as dwell in those country farms are never ignorant of agriculture,",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
11264,and so commit no errors which might otherwise be fatal and bring them,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
11265,under a scarcity of corn.  But though there is every year such a shifting,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
11266,of the husbandmen to prevent any man being forced against his will to,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
11267,"follow that hard course of life too long, yet many among them take such",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
11268,pleasure in it that they desire leave to continue in it many years.  These,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
11269,"husbandmen till the ground, breed cattle, hew wood, and convey it to the",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
11270,"towns either by land or water, as is most convenient.  They breed an",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
11271,infinite multitude of chickens in a very curious manner; for the hens do,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
11272,"not sit and hatch them, but a vast number of eggs are laid in a gentle",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
11273,"and equal heat in order to be hatched, and they are no sooner out of the",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
11274,"shell, and able to stir about, but they seem to consider those that feed",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
11275,"them as their mothers, and follow them as other chickens do the hen that",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
11276,"hatched them.  They breed very few horses, but those they have are full",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
11277,"of mettle, and are kept only for exercising their youth in the art of",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
11278,"sitting and riding them; for they do not put them to any work, either of",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
11279,"ploughing or carriage, in which they employ oxen.  For though their",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
11280,"horses are stronger, yet they find oxen can hold out longer; and as they",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
11281,"are not subject to so many diseases, so they are kept upon a less charge",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
11282,and with less trouble.  And even when they are so worn out that they are,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
11283,"no more fit for labour, they are good meat at last.  They sow no corn but",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
11284,"that which is to be their bread; for they drink either wine, cider or",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
11285,"perry, and often water, sometimes boiled with honey or liquorice, with",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
11286,which they abound; and though they know exactly how much corn will serve,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
11287,"every town and all that tract of country which belongs to it, yet they",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
11288,sow much more and breed more cattle than are necessary for their,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
11289,"consumption, and they give that overplus of which they make no use to",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
11290,their neighbours.  When they want anything in the country which it does,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
11291,"not produce, they fetch that from the town, without carrying anything in",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
11292,exchange for it.  And the magistrates of the town take care to see it,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
11293,"given them; for they meet generally in the town once a month, upon a",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
11294,"festival day.  When the time of harvest comes, the magistrates in the",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
11295,country send to those in the towns and let them know how many hands they,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
11296,will need for reaping the harvest; and the number they call for being,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"

11312,"figure is almost square, for from the one side of it, which shoots up",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
11313,"almost to the top of the hill, it runs down, in a descent for two miles,",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
11314,to the river Anider; but it is a little broader the other way that runs,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
11315,along by the bank of that river.  The Anider rises about eighty miles,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
11316,"above Amaurot, in a small spring at first.  But other brooks falling into",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"

11318,"Amaurot it is grown half a mile broad; but, it still grows larger and",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
11319,"larger, till, after sixty miles' course below it, it is lost in the",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
11320,"ocean.  Between the town and the sea, and for some miles above the town,",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
11321,it ebbs and flows every six hours with a strong current.  The tide comes,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
11322,up about thirty miles so full that there is nothing but salt water in the,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
11323,"river, the fresh water being driven back with its force; and above that,",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
11324,"for some miles, the water is brackish; but a little higher, as it runs by",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
11325,"the town, it is quite fresh; and when the tide ebbs, it continues fresh",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
11326,"all along to the sea.  There is a bridge cast over the river, not of",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
11327,"timber, but of fair stone, consisting of many stately arches; it lies at",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
11328,"that part of the town which is farthest from the sea, so that the ships,",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
11329,"without any hindrance, lie all along the side of the town.  There is,",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
11330,"likewise, another river that runs by it, which, though it is not great,",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
11331,"yet it runs pleasantly, for it rises out of the same hill on which the",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
11332,"town stands, and so runs down through it and falls into the Anider.  The",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
11333,"inhabitants have fortified the fountain-head of this river, which springs",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
11334,"a little without the towns; that so, if they should happen to be",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
11335,"besieged, the enemy might not be able to stop or divert the course of the",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
11336,"water, nor poison it; from thence it is carried, in earthen pipes, to the",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
11337,lower streets.  And for those places of the town to which the water of,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
11338,"that small river cannot be conveyed, they have great cisterns for",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
11339,"receiving the rain-water, which supplies the want of the other.  The town",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
11340,"is compassed with a high and thick wall, in which there are many towers",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
11341,"and forts; there is also a broad and deep dry ditch, set thick with",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
11342,"thorns, cast round three sides of the town, and the river is instead of a",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
11343,ditch on the fourth side.  The streets are very convenient for all,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
11344,"carriage, and are well sheltered from the winds.  Their buildings are",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
11345,"good, and are so uniform that a whole side of a street looks like one",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
11346,house.  The streets are twenty feet broad; there lie gardens behind all,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
11347,"their houses.  These are large, but enclosed with buildings, that on all",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
11348,"hands face the streets, so that every house has both a door to the street",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
11349,"and a back door to the garden.  Their doors have all two leaves, which,",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
11350,"as they are easily opened, so they shut of their own accord; and, there",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
11351,"being no property among them, every man may freely enter into any house",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
11352,whatsoever.  At every ten years' end they shift their houses by lots.,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
11353,"They cultivate their gardens with great care, so that they have both",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
11354,"vines, fruits, herbs, and flowers in them; and all is so well ordered and",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
11355,so finely kept that I never saw gardens anywhere that were both so,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
11356,fruitful and so beautiful as theirs.  And this humour of ordering their,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
11357,"gardens so well is not only kept up by the pleasure they find in it, but",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
11358,"also by an emulation between the inhabitants of the several streets, who",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
11359,"vie with each other.  And there is, indeed, nothing belonging to the",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
11360,whole town that is both more useful and more pleasant.  So that he who,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
11361,founded the town seems to have taken care of nothing more than of their,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
11362,gardens; for they say the whole scheme of the town was designed at first,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
11363,"by Utopus, but he left all that belonged to the ornament and improvement",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
11364,"of it to be added by those that should come after him, that being too",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
11365,"much for one man to bring to perfection.  Their records, that contain the",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
11366,"history of their town and State, are preserved with an exact care, and",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
11367,run backwards seventeen hundred and sixty years.  From these it appears,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
11368,"that their houses were at first low and mean, like cottages, made of any",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
11369,"sort of timber, and were built with mud walls and thatched with straw.",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
11370,"But now their houses are three storeys high, the fronts of them are faced",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
11371,"either with stone, plastering, or brick, and between the facings of their",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
11372,"walls they throw in their rubbish.  Their roofs are flat, and on them",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"

11374,"tempered that it is not apt to take fire, and yet resists the weather",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
11375,"more than lead.  They have great quantities of glass among them, with",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
11376,which they glaze their windows; they use also in their windows a thin,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"

11390,the Prince out of a list of four who are named by the people of the four,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"

11393,"office: they give him their voices secretly, so that it is not known for",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
11394,"whom every one gives his suffrage.  The Prince is for life, unless he is",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"

11404,relates to the public till it has been first debated three several days,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
11405,in their council.  It is death for any to meet and consult concerning the,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"

11447,"of the trades formerly mentioned.  Women, for the most part, deal in wool",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
11448,"and flax, which suit best with their weakness, leaving the ruder trades",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
11449,"to the men.  The same trade generally passes down from father to son,",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
11450,inclinations often following descent: but if any man's genius lies,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
11451,"another way he is, by adoption, translated into a family that deals in",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
11452,"the trade to which he is inclined; and when that is to be done, care is",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"

11477,"that time in their trades, as many of them do, they are not hindered, but",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
11478,"are rather commended, as men that take care to serve their country.  After",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
11479,"supper they spend an hour in some diversion, in summer in their gardens,",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
11480,"and in winter in the halls where they eat, where they entertain each",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
11481,"other either with music or discourse.  They do not so much as know dice,",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
11482,"or any such foolish and mischievous games.  They have, however, two sorts",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"

11496,apprehend if you consider how great a part of all other nations is quite,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
11497,"idle.  First, women generally do little, who are the half of mankind; and",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
11498,"if some few women are diligent, their husbands are idle: then consider",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
11499,"the great company of idle priests, and of those that are called religious",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
11500,"men; add to these all rich men, chiefly those that have estates in land,",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
11501,"who are called noblemen and gentlemen, together with their families, made",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
11502,"up of idle persons, that are kept more for show than use; add to these",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
11503,all those strong and lusty beggars that go about pretending some disease,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
11504,in excuse for their begging; and upon the whole account you will find,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
11505,that the number of those by whose labours mankind is supplied is much,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
11506,less than you perhaps imagined: then consider how few of those that work,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
11507,"are employed in labours that are of real service, for we, who measure all",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
11508,"things by money, give rise to many trades that are both vain and",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
11509,"superfluous, and serve only to support riot and luxury: for if those who",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
11510,work were employed only in such things as the conveniences of life,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
11511,"require, there would be such an abundance of them that the prices of them",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
11512,would so sink that tradesmen could not be maintained by their gains; if,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
11513,all those who labour about useless things were set to more profitable,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
11514,"employments, and if all they that languish out their lives in sloth and",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
11515,idleness (every one of whom consumes as much as any two of the men that,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
11516,"are at work) were forced to labour, you may easily imagine that a small",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
11517,"proportion of time would serve for doing all that is either necessary,",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
11518,"profitable, or pleasant to mankind, especially while pleasure is kept",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
11519,"within its due bounds: this appears very plainly in Utopia; for there, in",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
11520,"a great city, and in all the territory that lies round it, you can scarce",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
11521,"find five hundred, either men or women, by their age and strength capable",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
11522,"of labour, that are not engaged in it.  Even the Syphogrants, though",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
11523,"excused by the law, yet do not excuse themselves, but work, that by their",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
11524,examples they may excite the industry of the rest of the people; the like,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
11525,"exemption is allowed to those who, being recommended to the people by the",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
11526,"priests, are, by the secret suffrages of the Syphogrants, privileged from",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
11527,"labour, that they may apply themselves wholly to study; and if any of",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
11528,"these fall short of those hopes that they seemed at first to give, they",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
11529,are obliged to return to work; and sometimes a mechanic that so employs,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
11530,his leisure hours as to make a considerable advancement in learning is,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
11531,eased from being a tradesman and ranked among their learned men.  Out of,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
11532,"these they choose their ambassadors, their priests, their Tranibors, and",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
11533,"the Prince himself, anciently called their Barzenes, but is called of",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
11534,late their Ademus.,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
11535,,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
11536,"""And thus from the great numbers among them that are neither suffered to",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
11537,"be idle nor to be employed in any fruitless labour, you may easily make",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
11538,the estimate how much may be done in those few hours in which they are,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
11539,"obliged to labour.  But, besides all that has been already said, it is to",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
11540,be considered that the needful arts among them are managed with less,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
11541,labour than anywhere else.  The building or the repairing of houses among,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
11542,"us employ many hands, because often a thriftless heir suffers a house",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
11543,"that his father built to fall into decay, so that his successor must, at",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
11544,"a great cost, repair that which he might have kept up with a small",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
11545,charge; it frequently happens that the same house which one person built,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
11546,"at a vast expense is neglected by another, who thinks he has a more",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
11547,"delicate sense of the beauties of architecture, and he, suffering it to",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
11548,"fall to ruin, builds another at no less charge.  But among the Utopians",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
11549,all things are so regulated that men very seldom build upon a new piece,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
11550,"of ground, and are not only very quick in repairing their houses, but",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
11551,"show their foresight in preventing their decay, so that their buildings",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
11552,"are preserved very long with but very little labour, and thus the",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
11553,"builders, to whom that care belongs, are often without employment, except",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
11554,"the hewing of timber and the squaring of stones, that the materials may",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
11555,be in readiness for raising a building very suddenly when there is any,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
11556,"occasion for it.  As to their clothes, observe how little work is spent",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
11557,in them; while they are at labour they are clothed with leather and,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
11558,"skins, cut carelessly about them, which will last seven years, and when",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
11559,they appear in public they put on an upper garment which hides the other;,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
11560,"and these are all of one colour, and that is the natural colour of the",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
11561,"wool.  As they need less woollen cloth than is used anywhere else, so",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
11562,that which they make use of is much less costly; they use linen cloth,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
11563,"more, but that is prepared with less labour, and they value cloth only by",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
11564,"the whiteness of the linen or the cleanness of the wool, without much",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
11565,regard to the fineness of the thread.  While in other places four or five,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
11566,"upper garments of woollen cloth of different colours, and as many vests",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
11567,"of silk, will scarce serve one man, and while those that are nicer think",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
11568,"ten too few, every man there is content with one, which very often serves",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
11569,"him two years; nor is there anything that can tempt a man to desire more,",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
11570,"for if he had them he would neither be the, warmer nor would he make one",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
11571,"jot the better appearance for it.  And thus, since they are all employed",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
11572,"in some useful labour, and since they content themselves with fewer",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
11573,"things, it falls out that there is a great abundance of all things among",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
11574,"them; so that it frequently happens that, for want of other work, vast",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
11575,numbers are sent out to mend the highways; but when no public undertaking,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
11576,"is to be performed, the hours of working are lessened.  The magistrates",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
11577,"never engage the people in unnecessary labour, since the chief end of the",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
11578,"constitution is to regulate labour by the necessities of the public, and",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
11579,to allow the people as much time as is necessary for the improvement of,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"

11606,draw out a number of their citizens out of the several towns and send,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
11607,"them over to the neighbouring continent, where, if they find that the",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
11608,"inhabitants have more soil than they can well cultivate, they fix a",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"

11631,"every family, as has been already said, is its governor; wives serve",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
11632,"their husbands, and children their parents, and always the younger serves",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
11633,"the elder.  Every city is divided into four equal parts, and in the",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"

11641,a man's asking for more than he needs; they have no inducements to do,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"

11643,of want that makes any of the whole race of animals either greedy or,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
11644,"ravenous; but, besides fear, there is in man a pride that makes him fancy",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
11645,it a particular glory to excel others in pomp and excess; but by the laws,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
11646,"of the Utopians, there is no room for this.  Near these markets there are",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
11647,"others for all sorts of provisions, where there are not only herbs,",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"

11661,the stewards of every one of them come to the market-place at an,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
11662,"appointed hour, and according to the number of those that belong to the",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"

11664,than of any others; these are lodged and provided for in public,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
11665,"hospitals.  They have belonging to every town four hospitals, that are",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"

11705,if death or sickness does not intervene; and in that case the,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
11706,"Syphogrants' wives find out a nurse quickly, which is no hard matter, for",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"

11820,whom they more willingly expose to danger than their own people; they,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"

11826,"almost afraid to tell, lest you think it so extravagant as to be hardly",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"

11905,mistaken in the impression which they hoped this pomp would have made on,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"

11997,"that term belong only to the endowments of the soul.  They inquire,",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
11998,"likewise, into the nature of virtue and pleasure.  But their chief",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
11999,"dispute is concerning the happiness of a man, and wherein it",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
12000,"consists--whether in some one thing or in a great many.  They seem,",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
12001,"indeed, more inclinable to that opinion that places, if not the whole,",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
12002,"yet the chief part, of a man's happiness in pleasure; and, what may seem",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
12003,"more strange, they make use of arguments even from religion,",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
12004,"notwithstanding its severity and roughness, for the support of that",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
12005,opinion so indulgent to pleasure; for they never dispute concerning,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
12006,happiness without fetching some arguments from the principles of religion,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
12007,"as well as from natural reason, since without the former they reckon that",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"

12019,"pleasure might not stand in the way of a greater, and that no pleasure",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
12020,ought to be pursued that should draw a great deal of pain after it; for,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
12021,"they think it the maddest thing in the world to pursue virtue, that is a",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"

12025,"whole life, not only without pleasure, but in pain, if there is nothing",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
12026,to be expected after death?  Yet they do not place happiness in all sorts,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
12027,"of pleasures, but only in those that in themselves are good and honest.",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
12028,There is a party among them who place happiness in bare virtue; others,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
12029,"think that our natures are conducted by virtue to happiness, as that",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
12030,which is the chief good of man.  They define virtue thus--that it is a,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
12031,"living according to Nature, and think that we are made by God for that",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
12032,end; they believe that a man then follows the dictates of Nature when he,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
12033,pursues or avoids things according to the direction of reason.  They say,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
12034,that the first dictate of reason is the kindling in us a love and,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
12035,"reverence for the Divine Majesty, to whom we owe both all that we have",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
12036,"and, all that we can ever hope for.  In the next place, reason directs us",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
12037,"to keep our minds as free from passion and as cheerful as we can, and",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
12038,that we should consider ourselves as bound by the ties of good-nature and,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
12039,humanity to use our utmost endeavours to help forward the happiness of,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
12040,all other persons; for there never was any man such a morose and severe,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
12041,"pursuer of virtue, such an enemy to pleasure, that though he set hard",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"

12055,"it, why, then, ought not a man to begin with himself? since no man can be",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"

12057,"Nature cannot direct us to be good and kind to others, and yet at the",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"

12077,man to seek for pleasure by snatching another man's pleasures from him;,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
12078,"and, on the contrary, they think it a sign of a gentle and good soul for",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"

12080,by this means a good man finds as much pleasure one way as he parts with,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
12081,another; for as he may expect the like from others when he may come to,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
12082,"need it, so, if that should fail him, yet the sense of a good action, and",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
12083,the reflections that he makes on the love and gratitude of those whom he,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
12084,"has so obliged, gives the mind more pleasure than the body could have",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
12085,found in that from which it had restrained itself.  They are also,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
12086,persuaded that God will make up the loss of those small pleasures with a,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"

12092,"of body or mind, in which Nature teaches us to delight, a pleasure.  Thus",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
12093,they cautiously limit pleasure only to those appetites to which Nature,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
12094,leads us; for they say that Nature leads us only to those delights to,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"

12112,"both in the opinion they have of their clothes, and in that they have of",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
12113,"themselves.  For if you consider the use of clothes, why should a fine",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
12114,"thread be thought better than a coarse one?  And yet these men, as if",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
12115,"they had some real advantages beyond others, and did not owe them wholly",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
12116,"to their mistakes, look big, seem to fancy themselves to be more",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
12117,"valuable, and imagine that a respect is due to them for the sake of a",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
12118,"rich garment, to which they would not have pretended if they had been",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
12119,"more meanly clothed, and even resent it as an affront if that respect is",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
12120,not paid them.  It is also a great folly to be taken with outward marks,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
12121,"of respect, which signify nothing; for what true or real pleasure can one",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
12122,man find in another's standing bare or making legs to him?  Will the,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
12123,bending another man's knees give ease to yours? and will the head's being,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
12124,bare cure the madness of yours?  And yet it is wonderful to see how this,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
12125,false notion of pleasure bewitches many who delight themselves with the,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
12126,"fancy of their nobility, and are pleased with this conceit--that they are",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
12127,"descended from ancestors who have been held for some successions rich,",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
12128,and who have had great possessions; for this is all that makes nobility,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"

12130,"though their immediate parents have left none of this wealth to them, or",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"

12203,"when we are relieved from sudden pain, or that which arises from",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
12204,satisfying the appetite which Nature has wisely given to lead us to the,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"

12225,the body.  But this opinion has been long ago excluded from among them;,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
12226,so that now they almost universally agree that health is the greatest of,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
12227,all bodily pleasures; and that as there is a pain in sickness which is as,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
12228,"opposite in its nature to pleasure as sickness itself is to health, so",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
12229,they hold that health is accompanied with pleasure.  And if any should,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
12230,"say that sickness is not really pain, but that it only carries pain along",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
12231,"with it, they look upon that as a fetch of subtlety that does not much",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
12232,"alter the matter.  It is all one, in their opinion, whether it be said",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
12233,"that health is in itself a pleasure, or that it begets a pleasure, as",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
12234,"fire gives heat, so it be granted that all those whose health is entire",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
12235,have a true pleasure in the enjoyment of it.  And they reason thus:--'What,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
12236,"is the pleasure of eating, but that a man's health, which had been",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
12237,"weakened, does, with the assistance of food, drive away hunger, and so",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
12238,"recruiting itself, recovers its former vigour?  And being thus refreshed",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
12239,"it finds a pleasure in that conflict; and if the conflict is pleasure,",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
12240,"the victory must yet breed a greater pleasure, except we fancy that it",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
12241,"becomes stupid as soon as it has obtained that which it pursued, and so",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
12242,neither knows nor rejoices in its own welfare.'  If it is said that,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
12243,"health cannot be felt, they absolutely deny it; for what man is in",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
12244,"health, that does not perceive it when he is awake?  Is there any man",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
12245,that is so dull and stupid as not to acknowledge that he feels a delight,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
12246,in health?  And what is delight but another name for pleasure?,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
12247,,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
12248,"""But, of all pleasures, they esteem those to be most valuable that lie in",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
12249,"the mind, the chief of which arise out of true virtue and the witness of",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
12250,a good conscience.  They account health the chief pleasure that belongs,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
12251,"to the body; for they think that the pleasure of eating and drinking, and",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
12252,"all the other delights of sense, are only so far desirable as they give",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
12253,or maintain health; but they are not pleasant in themselves otherwise,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
12254,than as they resist those impressions that our natural infirmities are,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
12255,still making upon us.  For as a wise man desires rather to avoid diseases,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
12256,"than to take physic, and to be freed from pain rather than to find ease",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
12257,"by remedies, so it is more desirable not to need this sort of pleasure",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
12258,than to be obliged to indulge it.  If any man imagines that there is a,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
12259,"real happiness in these enjoyments, he must then confess that he would be",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
12260,"the happiest of all men if he were to lead his life in perpetual hunger,",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
12261,"thirst, and itching, and, by consequence, in perpetual eating, drinking,",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
12262,and scratching himself; which any one may easily see would be not only a,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
12263,"base, but a miserable, state of a life.  These are, indeed, the lowest of",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
12264,"pleasures, and the least pure, for we can never relish them but when they",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
12265,are mixed with the contrary pains.  The pain of hunger must give us the,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
12266,"pleasure of eating, and here the pain out-balances the pleasure.  And as",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
12267,"the pain is more vehement, so it lasts much longer; for as it begins",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
12268,"before the pleasure, so it does not cease but with the pleasure that",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
12269,"extinguishes it, and both expire together.  They think, therefore, none",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
12270,of those pleasures are to be valued any further than as they are,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
12271,"necessary; yet they rejoice in them, and with due gratitude acknowledge",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
12272,"the tenderness of the great Author of Nature, who has planted in us",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
12273,"appetites, by which those things that are necessary for our preservation",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
12274,are likewise made pleasant to us.  For how miserable a thing would life,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
12275,be if those daily diseases of hunger and thirst were to be carried off by,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
12276,such bitter drugs as we must use for those diseases that return seldomer,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
12277,"upon us!  And thus these pleasant, as well as proper, gifts of Nature",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
12278,maintain the strength and the sprightliness of our bodies.,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
12279,,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
12280,"""They also entertain themselves with the other delights let in at their",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
12281,"eyes, their ears, and their nostrils as the pleasant relishes and",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
12282,"seasoning of life, which Nature seems to have marked out peculiarly for",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
12283,"man, since no other sort of animals contemplates the figure and beauty of",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
12284,"the universe, nor is delighted with smells any further than as they",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
12285,distinguish meats by them; nor do they apprehend the concords or discords,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
12286,"of sound.  Yet, in all pleasures whatsoever, they take care that a lesser",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
12287,"joy does not hinder a greater, and that pleasure may never breed pain,",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
12288,which they think always follows dishonest pleasures.  But they think it,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
12289,madness for a man to wear out the beauty of his face or the force of his,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
12290,"natural strength, to corrupt the sprightliness of his body by sloth and",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
12291,"laziness, or to waste it by fasting; that it is madness to weaken the",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
12292,"strength of his constitution and reject the other delights of life,",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
12293,unless by renouncing his own satisfaction he can either serve the public,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
12294,"or promote the happiness of others, for which he expects a greater",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
12295,recompense from God.  So that they look on such a course of life as the,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
12296,mark of a mind that is both cruel to itself and ungrateful to the Author,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
12297,"of Nature, as if we would not be beholden to Him for His favours, and",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
12298,therefore rejects all His blessings; as one who should afflict himself,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
12299,"for the empty shadow of virtue, or for no better end than to render",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
12300,himself capable of bearing those misfortunes which possibly will never,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"

12306,leisure to examine whether they think right or wrong in this matter; nor,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
12307,"do I judge it necessary, for I have only undertaken to give you an",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"

12309,"am sure that whatever may be said of their notions, there is not in the",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
12310,whole world either a better people or a happier government.  Their bodies,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
12311,"are vigorous and lively; and though they are but of a middle stature, and",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
12312,have neither the fruitfullest soil nor the purest air in the world; yet,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
12313,"they fortify themselves so well, by their temperate course of life,",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
12314,"against the unhealthiness of their air, and by their industry they so",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
12315,"cultivate their soil, that there is nowhere to be seen a greater",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
12316,"increase, both of corn and cattle, nor are there anywhere healthier men",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
12317,and freer from diseases; for one may there see reduced to practice not,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
12318,only all the art that the husbandman employs in manuring and improving an,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
12319,"ill soil, but whole woods plucked up by the roots, and in other places",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
12320,"new ones planted, where there were none before.  Their principal motive",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
12321,"for this is the convenience of carriage, that their timber may be either",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
12322,"near their towns or growing on the banks of the sea, or of some rivers,",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
12323,so as to be floated to them; for it is a harder work to carry wood at any,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
12324,"distance over land than corn.  The people are industrious, apt to learn,",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
12325,"as well as cheerful and pleasant, and none can endure more labour when it",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
12326,"is necessary; but, except in that case, they love their ease.  They are",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
12327,unwearied pursuers of knowledge; for when we had given them some hints of,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
12328,"the learning and discipline of the Greeks, concerning whom we only",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
12329,"instructed them (for we know that there was nothing among the Romans,",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
12330,"except their historians and their poets, that they would value much), it",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
12331,was strange to see how eagerly they were set on learning that language:,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
12332,"we began to read a little of it to them, rather in compliance with their",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
12333,importunity than out of any hopes of their reaping from it any great,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
12334,"advantage: but, after a very short trial, we found they made such",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
12335,"progress, that we saw our labour was like to be more successful than we",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
12336,could have expected: they learned to write their characters and to,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
12337,"pronounce their language so exactly, had so quick an apprehension, they",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
12338,"remembered it so faithfully, and became so ready and correct in the use",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
12339,"of it, that it would have looked like a miracle if the greater part of",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
12340,those whom we taught had not been men both of extraordinary capacity and,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
12341,"of a fit age for instruction: they were, for the greatest part, chosen",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
12342,"from among their learned men by their chief council, though some studied",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
12343,it of their own accord.  In three years' time they became masters of the,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
12344,"whole language, so that they read the best of the Greek authors very",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
12345,"exactly.  I am, indeed, apt to think that they learned that language the",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
12346,more easily from its having some relation to their own.  I believe that,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
12347,they were a colony of the Greeks; for though their language comes nearer,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
12348,"the Persian, yet they retain many names, both for their towns and",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
12349,"magistrates, that are of Greek derivation.  I happened to carry a great",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
12350,"many books with me, instead of merchandise, when I sailed my fourth",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
12351,"voyage; for I was so far from thinking of soon coming back, that I rather",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
12352,"thought never to have returned at all, and I gave them all my books,",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
12353,among which were many of Plato's and some of Aristotle's works: I had,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
12354,"also Theophrastus on Plants, which, to my great regret, was imperfect;",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
12355,"for having laid it carelessly by, while we were at sea, a monkey had",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
12356,"seized upon it, and in many places torn out the leaves.  They have no",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
12357,"books of grammar but Lascares, for I did not carry Theodorus with me; nor",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
12358,have they any dictionaries but Hesichius and Dioscerides.  They esteem,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
12359,"Plutarch highly, and were much taken with Lucian's wit and with his",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
12360,"pleasant way of writing.  As for the poets, they have Aristophanes,",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
12361,"Homer, Euripides, and Sophocles of Aldus's edition; and for historians,",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
12362,"Thucydides, Herodotus, and Herodian.  One of my companions, Thricius",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
12363,"Apinatus, happened to carry with him some of Hippocrates's works and",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
12364,"Galen's Microtechne, which they hold in great estimation; for though",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
12365,"there is no nation in the world that needs physic so little as they do,",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
12366,yet there is not any that honours it so much; they reckon the knowledge,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
12367,"of it one of the pleasantest and most profitable parts of philosophy, by",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
12368,"which, as they search into the secrets of nature, so they not only find",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
12369,"this study highly agreeable, but think that such inquiries are very",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"

12373,"contemplating it, so an exact and curious observer, who admires His",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"

12386,manner.  They seized the hints we gave them; and though at first they,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
12387,"could not arrive at perfection, yet by making many essays they at last",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
12388,found out and corrected all their errors and conquered every difficulty.,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
12389,"Before this they only wrote on parchment, on reeds, or on the barks of",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"

12471,"it is constantly observed among them, and is accounted perfectly",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
12472,consistent with wisdom.  Before marriage some grave matron presents the,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"

12474,"after that some grave man presents the bridegroom, naked, to the bride.",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
12475,"We, indeed, both laughed at this, and condemned it as very indecent.  But",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"

12477,"nations, who, if they are but to buy a horse of a small value, are so",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
12478,"cautious that they will see every part of him, and take off both his",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"

12483,"the rest of the body being covered, under which may lie hid what may be",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
12484,contagious as well as loathsome.  All men are not so wise as to choose a,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"

12496,"insufferable perverseness, for in these cases the Senate dissolves the",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"

12498,guilty are made infamous and are never allowed the privilege of a second,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
12499,"marriage.  None are suffered to put away their wives against their wills,",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
12500,"from any great calamity that may have fallen on their persons, for they",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
12501,look on it as the height of cruelty and treachery to abandon either of,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
12502,"the married persons when they need most the tender care of their consort,",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
12503,"and that chiefly in the case of old age, which, as it carries many",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
12504,"diseases along with it, so it is a disease of itself.  But it frequently",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
12505,"falls out that when a married couple do not well agree, they, by mutual",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
12506,"consent, separate, and find out other persons with whom they hope they",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
12507,may live more happily; yet this is not done without obtaining leave of,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"

12509,"made, both by the senators and their wives, into the grounds upon which",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
12510,"it is desired, and even when they are satisfied concerning the reasons of",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
12511,"it they go on but slowly, for they imagine that too great easiness in",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
12512,granting leave for new marriages would very much shake the kindness of,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"

12514,"if both parties are married they are divorced, and the injured persons",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
12515,"may marry one another, or whom they please, but the adulterer and the",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"

12517,cannot shake off the love of the married person they may live with them,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"

12526,"is left to the Senate, to temper it according to the circumstances of the",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"

12528,"their children, unless the fault is so great that a public punishment is",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
12529,thought necessary for striking terror into others.  For the most part,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
12530,"slavery is the punishment even of the greatest crimes, for as that is no",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
12531,"less terrible to the criminals themselves than death, so they think the",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
12532,preserving them in a state of servitude is more for the interest of the,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
12533,"commonwealth than killing them, since, as their labour is a greater",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
12534,"benefit to the public than their death could be, so the sight of their",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
12535,misery is a more lasting terror to other men than that which would be,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
12536,"given by their death.  If their slaves rebel, and will not bear their",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
12537,"yoke and submit to the labour that is enjoined them, they are treated as",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
12538,"wild beasts that cannot be kept in order, neither by a prison nor by",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
12539,"their chains, and are at last put to death.  But those who bear their",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
12540,"punishment patiently, and are so much wrought on by that pressure that",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
12541,"lies so hard on them, that it appears they are really more troubled for",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
12542,"the crimes they have committed than for the miseries they suffer, are not",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
12543,"out of hope, but that, at last, either the Prince will, by his",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
12544,"prerogative, or the people, by their intercession, restore them again to",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
12545,"their liberty, or, at least, very much mitigate their slavery.  He that",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
12546,tempts a married woman to adultery is no less severely punished than he,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
12547,"that commits it, for they believe that a deliberate design to commit a",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
12548,"crime is equal to the fact itself, since its not taking effect does not",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"

12553,"people to divert themselves with their folly; and, in their opinion, this",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
12554,is a great advantage to the fools themselves; for if men were so sullen,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
12555,and severe as not at all to please themselves with their ridiculous,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
12556,"behaviour and foolish sayings, which is all that they can do to recommend",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
12557,"themselves to others, it could not be expected that they would be so well",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
12558,provided for nor so tenderly used as they must otherwise be.  If any man,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
12559,should reproach another for his being misshaped or imperfect in any part,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
12560,"of his body, it would not at all be thought a reflection on the person so",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
12561,"treated, but it would be accounted scandalous in him that had upbraided",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
12562,another with what he could not help.  It is thought a sign of a sluggish,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
12563,and sordid mind not to preserve carefully one's natural beauty; but it is,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
12564,likewise infamous among them to use paint.  They all see that no beauty,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
12565,recommends a wife so much to her husband as the probity of her life and,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
12566,"her obedience; for as some few are caught and held only by beauty, so all",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"

12607,"every man may know his duty; and, therefore, the plainest and most",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
12608,"obvious sense of the words is that which ought to be put upon them, since",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"

12851,"entirely does their avarice influence them; and yet this money, which",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"

12863,"to such as escape.  This animates them to adventure again, whenever there",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
12864,is occasion for it; for the Utopians are not at all troubled how many of,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
12865,"these happen to be killed, and reckon it a service done to mankind if",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"

12878,"offer themselves, for none are forced to go against their wills, since",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
12879,"they think that if any man is pressed that wants courage, he will not",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
12880,"only act faintly, but by his cowardice dishearten others.  But if an",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
12881,"invasion is made on their country, they make use of such men, if they",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
12882,"have good bodies, though they are not brave; and either put them aboard",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
12883,"their ships, or place them on the walls of their towns, that being so",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
12884,"posted, they may find no opportunity of flying away; and thus either",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
12885,"shame, the heat of action, or the impossibility of flying, bears down",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
12886,"their cowardice; they often make a virtue of necessity, and behave",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
12887,"themselves well, because nothing else is left them.  But as they force no",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
12888,"man to go into any foreign war against his will, so they do not hinder",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
12889,those women who are willing to go along with their husbands; on the,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
12890,"contrary, they encourage and praise them, and they stand often next their",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
12891,husbands in the front of the army.  They also place together those who,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
12892,"are related, parents, and children, kindred, and those that are mutually",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
12893,"allied, near one another; that those whom nature has inspired with the",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
12894,greatest zeal for assisting one another may be the nearest and readiest,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
12895,to do it; and it is matter of great reproach if husband or wife survive,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
12896,"one another, or if a child survives his parent, and therefore when they",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
12897,"come to be engaged in action, they continue to fight to the last man, if",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
12898,their enemies stand before them: and as they use all prudent methods to,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
12899,"avoid the endangering their own men, and if it is possible let all the",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"

12901,"necessary for themselves to engage, they then charge with as much courage",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
12902,as they avoided it before with prudence: nor is it a fierce charge at,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
12903,"first, but it increases by degrees; and as they continue in action, they",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
12904,"grow more obstinate, and press harder upon the enemy, insomuch that they",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
12905,will much sooner die than give ground; for the certainty that their,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"

12907,that anxiety concerning them which often masters men of great courage;,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
12908,and thus they are animated by a noble and invincible resolution.  Their,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
12909,skill in military affairs increases their courage: and the wise,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
12910,"sentiments which, according to the laws of their country, are instilled",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
12911,"into them in their education, give additional vigour to their minds: for",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
12912,"as they do not undervalue life so as prodigally to throw it away, they",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
12913,are not so indecently fond of it as to preserve it by base and unbecoming,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
12914,"methods.  In the greatest heat of action the bravest of their youth, who",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
12915,"have devoted themselves to that service, single out the general of their",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
12916,"enemies, set on him either openly or by ambuscade; pursue him everywhere,",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
12917,"and when spent and wearied out, are relieved by others, who never give",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
12918,"over the pursuit, either attacking him with close weapons when they can",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
12919,"get near him, or with those which wound at a distance, when others get in",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
12920,"between them.  So that, unless he secures himself by flight, they seldom",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
12921,fail at last to kill or to take him prisoner.  When they have obtained a,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
12922,"victory, they kill as few as possible, and are much more bent on taking",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
12923,many prisoners than on killing those that fly before them.  Nor do they,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
12924,ever let their men so loose in the pursuit of their enemies as not to,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
12925,retain an entire body still in order; so that if they have been forced to,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
12926,"engage the last of their battalions before they could gain the day, they",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
12927,will rather let their enemies all escape than pursue them when their own,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
12928,army is in disorder; remembering well what has often fallen out to,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"

12930,"and broken, when their enemies, imagining the victory obtained, have let",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"

12933,"and when straggling in disorder, and apprehensive of no danger, but",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"

12941,"to find out their design.  If they see they are ill posted, or are like",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
12942,"to be overpowered by numbers, they then either march off in the night",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
12943,"with great silence, or by some stratagem delude their enemies.  If they",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
12944,"retire in the day-time, they do it in such order that it is no less",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
12945,dangerous to fall upon them in a retreat than in a march.  They fortify,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
12946,their camps with a deep and large trench; and throw up the earth that is,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
12947,"dug out of it for a wall; nor do they employ only their slaves in this,",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"

13217,are chosen to supply their room in their absence; but these enter again,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
13218,upon their employments when they return; and those who served in their,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"

13223,"of priests.  The care of all sacred things, the worship of God, and an",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
13224,"inspection into the manners of the people, are committed to them.  It is",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
13225,"a reproach to a man to be sent for by any of them, or for them to speak",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
13226,"to him in secret, for that always gives some suspicion: all that is",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
13227,incumbent on them is only to exhort and admonish the people; for the,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
13228,"power of correcting and punishing ill men belongs wholly to the Prince,",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"

13230,the excluding those that are desperately wicked from joining in their,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
13231,worship: there is not any sort of punishment more dreaded by them than,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
13232,"this, for as it loads them with infamy, so it fills them with secret",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
13233,"horrors, such is their reverence to their religion; nor will their bodies",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
13234,be long exempted from their share of trouble; for if they do not very,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
13235,"quickly satisfy the priests of the truth of their repentance, they are",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
13236,"seized on by the Senate, and punished for their impiety.  The education",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
13237,"of youth belongs to the priests, yet they do not take so much care of",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
13238,"instructing them in letters, as in forming their minds and manners",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
13239,"aright; they use all possible methods to infuse, very early, into the",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
13240,"tender and flexible minds of children, such opinions as are both good in",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
13241,"themselves and will be useful to their country, for when deep impressions",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"
13242,"of these things are made at that age, they follow men through the whole",Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"

13245,ill opinions.  The wives of their priests are the most extraordinary,Utopia,"More, Thomas, Saint"

,"over into the Island, where the Emperor of the Blazing- world (for so it","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"

,"they counted more necessary and beneficial then the use of Compasses,","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"

,"the bowels of the Waves: Moreover, it is to be observed, that in a great","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,Tempest they would join their Ships in battel-aray: and when they feared,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"

,"were not much heavier then ours of Wood, by reason they were neatly","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"

,"Pitch, Tar, Pumps, Guns, and the like, which make our Woodden-Ships very","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"

,"Guns, there was no use of them, because they had no other enemies but","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"

,"fears, not knowing whether this strange Adventure would tend to her","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"

,"ready wit, considering what dangers she had past, and finding those","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"sorts of men civil and diligent attendants to her, took courage, and","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"

,"see, that Novelty discomposes the mind, but acquaintance settles it in","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"peace and tranquillity. At last, having passed by several rich Islands","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"and Kingdoms, they went towards Paradise, which was the seat of the","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Emperor; and coming in sight of it, rejoiced very much; the Lady at","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"first could perceive nothing but high Rocks, which seemed to touch the","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Skies; and although they appear'd not of an equal heigth, yet they","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"seemed to be all one piece, without partitions: but at last drawing","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"nearer, she perceived a clift, which was a part of those Rocks, out of","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"which she spied coming forth a great number of Boats, which afar off","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"shewed like a company of Ants, marching one after another; the Boats","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"appeared like the holes or partitions in a Honey-comb, and when joined","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"together, stood as close; the men were of several Complexions, but none","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"like any of our World; and when both the Boats and Ships met, they","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,saluted and spake to each other very courteously; for there was but one,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"language in all that World: nor no more but one Emperor, to whom they","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"

,"where the Emperor did reside; which part was very pleasant, and of a","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"

,"healthful, rich, and fruitful, as Nature could make them; and, as I","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"

,"street, which together with the Bridges, whereof there was a great","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"

,"Imperial City; at the top of which ascent was a broad Arch, supported by","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"several Pillars, which went round the Palace, and contained four of our","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"English miles in compass: within the Arch stood the Emperor's Guard,","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"which consisted of several sorts of Men; at every half mile, was a Gate","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"to enter, and every Gate was of a different fashion; the first, which","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"allowed a passage from the Imperial City into the Palace, had on either","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"hand a Cloyster, the outward part whereof stood upon Arches sustained by","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Pillars, but the inner part was close: Being entred through the Gate,","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"the Palace it self appear'd in its middle like the Isle of a Church, a","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"

,"Pillars were so just opposite to one another, that all the adornments","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"could not be seen at one. The first part of the Palace was, as the","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"

,"proper for the nature of their Species, which the Empress encouraged","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"them in, especially those that had applied themselves to the study of","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,several Arts and Sciences; for they were as ingenious and witty in the,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"invention of profitable and useful Arts, as we are in our world, nay,","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"more; and to that end she erected Schools, and founded several","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Societies. The Bear-men were to be her Experimental Philosophers, the","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"

,"having got a Soveraign power from the Emperor over all the World,","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,desired to be informed both of the manner of their Religion and,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Government; and to that end she called the Priests and States men, to","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"give her an account of either. Of the States men she enquired, first,","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Why they had so few Laws? To which they answered, That many Laws made","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"many Divisions, which most commonly did breed Factions, and at last","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"brake out into open Wars. Next, she asked, Why they preferred the","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Monarchical form of Government before any other? They answered, That as","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"it was natural for one Body to have but one Head, so it was also natural","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"for a Politick body to have but one Governor; and that a Common-wealth,","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"which had many Governors was like a Monster with many Heads. Besides,","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"said they, a Monarchy is a divine form of Government, and agrees most","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"with our Religion: For as there is but one God, whom we all unanimously","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,worship and adore with one Faith; so we are resolved to have but one,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Emperor, to whom we all submit with one obedience.","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,Then the Empress seeing that the several sorts of her Subjects had each,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"their Churches apart, asked the Priests, whether they were of several","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Religions? They answered her Majesty, That there was no more but one","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Religion in all that World, nor no diversity of opinions in that same","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Religion for though there were several sorts of men, yet had they all","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,but one opinion concerning the Worship and Adoration of God. The Empress,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"asked them, Whether they were Jews, Turks, or Christians? We do not","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"know, said they, what Religions those are; but we do all unanimously","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"acknowledg, worship and adore the Onely, Omnipotent, and Eternal God,","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"with all reverence, submission, and duty. Again, the Empress enquired,","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Whether they had several Forms of Worship? They answered, No: For our","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Devotion and Worship consists onely in Prayers, which we frame according","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"to our several Necessities, in Petitions, Humiliations, Thanksgiving,","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"&c. Truly, replied the Empress, I thought you had been either Jews, or","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Turks, because I never perceived any Women in your Congregations: But","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"what is the reason, you bar them from your religious Assemblies? It is","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"not fit, said they, that Men and Women should be promiscuously together","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"in time of Religious Worship; for their company hinders Devotion, and","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"makes many, instead of praying to God, direct their Devotion to their","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Mistresses. But, asked the Empress, Have they no Congregation of their","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"own, to perform the duties of Divine Worship, as well as Men? No,","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"answered they: but they stay at home, and say their Prayers by","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,themselves in their Closets. Then the Empress desir'd to know the reason,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,why the Priests and Governors of their World were made Eunuchs? They,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"answer'd, To keep them from Marriage: For Women and Children most","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"commonly make disturbance both in Church and State. But, said she, Women","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"and Children have no Employment in Church or State. 'Tis true, answer'd","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"they; but, although they are not admitted to publick Employments, yet","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"are they so prevalent with their Husbands and Parents, that many times","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"by their importunate perswasions, they cause as much, nay, more mischief","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"secretly, then if they had the management of publick Affairs.","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,The Empress having received an information of what concerned both Church,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"and State, passed some time in viewing the Imperial Palace, where she","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"admired much the skil and ingenuity of the Architects, and enquired of","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"them, first, Why they built their Houses no higher then two stories from","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"the Ground? They answered her Majesty, That the lower their Buildings","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"were, the less were they subject either to the heat of the Sun, or Wind,","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Tempest, Decay, &c. Then she desired to know the reason, why they made","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"them so thick? They answered, That, the thicker the Walls were, the","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"warmer they were in Winter, the cooler in Summer; for their thickness","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"kept out both the Cold and Heat. Lastly, she asked, Why they Arched","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"their Roofs, and made so many Pillars? They replied, That Arches and","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Pillars, did not onely grace a Building very much, and caused it to","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"appear Magnificent, but made it also firm and lasting.","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,The Empress was very well satisfied with their answers; and after some,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"time, when she thought that her new founded societies of the Vertuoso's","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,had made a good progress in the several Employments she had put them,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"upon, she caused a Convocation first of the Bird-men, and commanded them","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"to give her a true relation of the two Cúlestial Bodies, viz. the Sun","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"and Moon, which they did with all the obedience and faithfulness","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,befitting their duty.,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"The Sun, as much as they could observe, they related to be a firm or","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"solid Stone, of a vast bigness; of colour yellowish, and of an","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"extraordinary splendor: But the Moon, they said, was of a whitish","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"colour; and although she looked dim in the presence of the Sun, yet had","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"she her own light, and was a shining body of her self, as might be","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,perceived by her vigorous appearance in Moon-shiny-nights; the,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"difference onely betwixt her own and the Sun's light was, that the Sun","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,did strike his beams in a direct line; but the Moon never respected the,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Centre of their World in a right line, but her Centre was always","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"excentrical. The Spots both in the Sun and Moon, as far as they were","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"able to perceive, they affirmed to be nothing else but flaws and stains","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"of their stony Bodies. Concerning the heat of the Sun, they were not of","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"one opinion; some would have the Sun hot in it self, alledging an old","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Tradition, that it should at some time break asunder, and burn the","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Heavens, and consume this world into hot Embers, which, said they, could","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"not be done, if the Sun were not fiery of it self. Others again said,","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,This opinion could not stand with reason; for Fire being a destroyer of,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"all things, the Sun-Stone after this manner would burn up all the near","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"adjoining Bodies: Besides, said they, Fire cannot subsist without fuel;","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"and the Sun-Stone having nothing to feed on, would in a short time","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,consume it self; wherefore they thought it more probable that the Sun,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"was not actually hot, but onely by the reflection of its light; so that","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"its heat was an effect of its light, both being immaterial. But this","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"opinion again was laught at by others, and rejected as ridiculous, who","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,thought it impossible that one immaterial should produce another; and,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,believed that both the light and heat of the Sun proceeded from a swift,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Circular motion of the ∆thereal Globules, which by their striking upon","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"the Optick nerve, caused light, and their motion produced heat: But","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"neither would this opinion hold; for, said some, then it would follow,","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"that the sight of Animals is the cause of light; and that, were there no","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"eyes, there would be no light; which was against all sense and reason.","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Thus they argued concerning the heat and light of the Sun; but, which is","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"remarkable, none did say, that the Sun was a Globous fluid body, and had","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"a swift Circular motion; but all agreed, It was fixt and firm like a","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Center, and therefore they generally called it the Sun-Stone.","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Then the Empress asked them the reason, Why the Sun and Moon did often","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"appear in different postures or shapes, as sometimes magnified,","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"sometimes diminished; sometimes elevated, otherwhiles depressed; now","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"thrown to the right, and then to the left? To which some of the Bird-men","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"answered, That it proceeded from the various degrees of heat and cold,","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"which are found in the Air, from whence did follow a differing density","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"and rarity; and likewise from the vapours that are interposed, whereof","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"those that ascend are higher and less dense then the ambient air, but","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,those which descend are heavier and more dense. But others did with more,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"probability affirm, that it was nothing else but the various patterns of","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,the Air; for like as Painters do not copy out one and the same original,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"just alike at all times; so, said they, do several parts of the Air make","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,different patterns of the luminous Bodies of the Sun and Moon: which,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"patterns, as several copies, the sensitive motions do figure out in the","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,substance of our eyes.,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"This answer the Empress liked much better then the former, and enquired","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"further, What opinion they had of those Creatures that are called the","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"motes of the Sun? To which they answered, That they were nothing else","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"but streams of very small, rare and transparent particles, through which","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,the Sun was represented as through a glass: for if they were not,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"transparent, said they, they would eclipse the light of the Sun; and if","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"not rare and of an airy substance, they would hinder Flies from flying","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"in the Air, at least retard their flying motion: Nevertheless, although","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"they were thinner then the thinnest vapour, yet were they not so thin as","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"the body of air, or else they would not be perceptible by animal sight.","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Then the Empress asked, Whether they were living Creatures? They","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"answered, Yes: Because they did encrease and decrease, and were","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"nourished by the presence, and starved by the absence of the Sun.","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Having thus finished their discourse of the Sun and Moon, the Empress","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"desired to know what Stars there were besides? But they answer'd, that","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"they could perceive in that World none other but Blazing Stars, and from","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,thence it had the name that it was called the Blazing-World; and these,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Blazing-Stars, said they, were such solid, firm and shining bodies as","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"the Sun and Moon, not of a Globular, but of several sorts of figures:","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"some had tails; and some, other kinds of shapes.","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"After this, The Empress asked them, What kind of substance or creature","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"the Air was? The Bird-men answered, That they could have no other","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"perception of the Air, but by their own Respiration: For, said they,","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"some bodies are onely subject to touch, others onely to sight, and","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,others onely to smell; but some are subject to none of our exterior,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Senses: For Nature is so full of variety, that our weak Senses cannot","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,perceive all the various sorts of her Creatures; neither is there any,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"one object perceptible by all our Senses, no more then several objects","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"are by one sense. I believe you, replied the Empress; but if you can","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"give no account of the Air, said she, you will hardly be able to inform","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"me how Wind is made; for they say, that Wind is nothing but motion of","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"the Air. The Bird-men answer'd, That they observed Wind to be more dense","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"then Air, and therefore subject to the sense of Touch; but what properly","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Wind was, and the manner how it was made, they could not exactly tell;","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"some said, it was caused by the Clouds falling on each other; and","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"others, that it was produced of a hot and dry exhalation: which","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"ascending, was driven down again by the coldness of the Air that is in","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"the middle Region, and by reason of its leightness, could not go","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"directly to the bottom, but was carried by the Air up and down: Some","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"would have it a flowing Water of the Air; and others again, a flowing","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,Air moved by the blaz of the Stars.,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"But the Empress, seeing they could not agree concerning the cause of","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Wind, asked, Whether they could tell how Snow was made? To which they","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"answered That according to their observation, Snow was made by a","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"commixture of Water, and some certain extract of the Element of Fire","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"that is under the Moon; a small portion of which extract, being mixed","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"with Water, and beaten by Air or Wind, made a white Froth called Snow;","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"which being after some while dissolved by the heat of the same spirit,","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,turned to Water again. This observation amazed the Empress very much;,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"for she had hitherto believed, That Snow was made by cold motions, and","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,not by such an agitation or beating of a fiery extract upon water: Nor,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,could she be perswaded to believe it until the Fish- or Mear-men had,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"delivered their observation upon the making of Ice, which, they said,","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"was not produced, as some hitherto conceived, by the motion of the Air,","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"raking the Superficies of the Earth, but by some strong saline vapour","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"arising out of the Seas, which condensed Water into Ice; and the more","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"quantity there was of that vapour, the greater were the Mountains of","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,Precipices of Ice; but the reason that it did not so much freeze in the,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Torrid Zone, or under the Ecliptick, as near or under the Poles, was,","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,that this vapour in those places being drawn up by the Sun-beams into,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"the middle Region of the Air, was onely condensed into Water, and fell","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"down in showres of Rain; when as, under the Poles, the heat of the Sun","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"being not so vehement, the same vapour had no force or power to rise so","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"high, and therefore caused so much Ice, by ascending and acting onely","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,upon the surface of water.,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,This Relation confirmed partly the observation of the Bird-men,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,concerning the cause of Snow; but since they had made mention that that,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"same extract, which by its commixture with Water made Snow, proceeded","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"from the Element of Fire, that is under the Moon: The Emperess asked","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"them, of what nature that Elementary Fire was; whether it was like","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"ordinary Fire here upon Earth, or such a Fire as is within the bowels of","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"the Earth, and as the famous Mountains Vesuvius and ∆tna do burn withal;","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"or whether it was such a sort of fire, as is found in flints, &c. They","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"answered, That the Elementary Fire, which is underneath the Sun, was not","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,so solid as any of those mentioned fires; because it had no solid fuel,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"to feed on; but yet it was much like the flame of ordinary fire, onely","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"somewhat more thin and fluid; for Flame, said they, is nothing else but","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,the airy part of a fired Body.,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Lastly, the Empress asked the Bird-men of the nature of Thunder and","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,Lightning? and whether it was not caused by roves of Ice falling upon,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"each other? To which they answered, That it was not made that way, but","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,by an encounter of cold and heat; so that an exhalation being kindled in,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"the Clouds, did dash forth Lightning, and that there were so many","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,rentings of Clouds as there were Sounds and Cracking noises: But this,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"opinion was contradicted by others, who affirmed that Thunder was a","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"sudden and monstrous Blaz, stirred up in the Air, and did not always","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,require a Cloud; but the Empress not knowing what they meant by Blaz,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,(for even they themselves were not able to explain the sense of this,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"word) liked the former better; and, to avoid hereafter tedious disputes,","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,and have the truth of the PhÊnomena's of Cúlestial Bodies more exactly,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"known, commanded the Bear-men, which were her Experimental Philosophers,","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"to observe them through such Instruments as are called Telescopes, which","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,they did according to her Majesties Command; but these Telescopes caused,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"more differences and divisions amongst them, then ever they had before;","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"for some said, they perceived that the Sun stood still, and the Earth","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"did move about it; others were of opinion, that they both did move; and","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"others said again, that the Earth stood still, and Sun did move; some","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,counted more Stars then others; some discovered new Stars never seen,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,before; some fell into a great dispute with others concerning the,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"bigness of the Stars; some said, The Moon was another World like their","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Terrestrial Globe, and the spots therein were Hills and Vallies; but","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"others would have the spots to be the Terrestrial parts, and the smooth","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"and glossie parts, the Sea: At last, the Empress commanded them to go","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,with their Telescopes to the very end of the Pole that was joined to the,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"World she came from, and try whether they could perceive any Stars in","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"it: which they did; and, being returned to her Majesty, reported that","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"they had seen three Blazing-Stars appear there, one after another in a","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"short time, whereof two were bright, and one dim; but they could not","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"agree neither in this observation: for some said, It was but one Star","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"which appeared at three several times, in several places; and others","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,would have them to be three several Stars; for they thought it,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"impossible, that those three several appearances should have been but","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"one Star, because every Star did rise at a certain time, and appear'd in","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"a certain place, and did disappear in the same place: Next, It is","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"altogether improbable, said they, That one Star should fly from place to","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"place, especially at such a vast distance, without a visible motion; in","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"so short a time, and appear in such different places, whereof two were","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"quite opposite, and the third side-ways: Lastly, If it had been but one","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Star, said they, it would always have kept the same splendor, which it","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"did not; for, as above mentioned, two were bright, and one was dim.","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"After they had thus argued, the Empress began to grow angry at their","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Telescopes, that they could give no better Intelligence; for, said she,","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"now I do plainly perceive, that your Glasses are false Informers, and","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"instead of discovering the Truth, delude your Senses; Wherefore I","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Command you to break them, and let the Bird-men trust onely to their","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"natural eyes, and examine Cúlestial Objects by the motions of their own","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Sense and Reason. The Bear-men replied, That it was not the fault of","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"their Glasses, which caused such differences in their Opinions, but the","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"sensitive motions in their Optick organs did not move alike, nor were","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"their rational judgments always regular: To which the Empress answered,","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"That if their Glasses were true Informers, they would rectifie their","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"irregular Sense and Reason; But, said she, Nature has made your Sense","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,and Reason more regular then Art has your Glasses; for they are meer,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"deluders, and will never lead you to the knowledg of Truth; Wherefore I","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,command you again to break them; for you may observe the progressive,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,motions of Cúlestial Bodies with your natural eyes better then through,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,Artificial Glasses. The Bear-men being exceedingly troubled at her,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Majesties displeasure concerning their Telescopes, kneel'd down, and in","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"the humblest manner petitioned, that they might not be broken; for, said","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"they, we take more delight in Artificial delusions, then in Natural","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"truths. Besides, we shall want Imployments for our Senses, and Subjects","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"for Arguments; for, were there nothing but truth, and no falshood, there","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"would be no occasion to dispute, and by this means we should want the","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,aim and pleasure of our endeavors in confuting and contradicting each,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"other; neither would one man be thought wiser then another, but all","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"would either be alike knowing and wise, or all would be fools; wherefore","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"we most humbly beseech your Imperial Majesty to spare our Glasses, which","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"are our onely delight, and as dear to us as our lives. The Empress at","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"last consented to their request, but upon condition, that their disputes","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"and quarrels should remain within their Schools, and cause no factions","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"or disturbances in State, or Government. The Bear-men, full of joy,","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,returned their most humble thanks to the Empress; and to make her amends,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"for the displeasure which their Telescopes had occasioned, told her","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Majesty, that they had several other artificial Optick-Glasses, which","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,they were sure would give her Majesty a great deal more satisfaction.,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Amongst the rest, they brought forth several Microscopes, by the means","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"of which they could enlarge the shapes of little bodies, and make a","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Lowse appear as big as an Elephant, and a Mite as big as a Whale. First","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"of all they shewed the Empress a gray Drone-flye, wherein they observed","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"that the greatest part of her face, nay, of her head, consisted of two","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,large bunches all cover'd over with a multitude of small Pearls or,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Hemispheres in a Trigonal order: Which Pearls were of two degrees,","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"smaller and bigger; the smaller degree was lowermost, and looked towards","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"the ground; the other was upward, and looked sideward, forward and","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"backward: They were all so smooth and polished, that they were able to","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"represent the image of any object, the number of them was in all 14000.","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"After the view of this strange and miraculous Creature, and their","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"several observations upon it, the Empress asked them, What they judged","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"those little Hemispheres might be? They answered, That each of them was","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"a perfect Eye, by reason they perceived that each was covered with a","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Transparent Cornea, containing a liquor within them, which resembled the","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"watery or glassie humor of the Eye. To which the Emperess replied, That","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"they might be glassie Pearls, and yet not Eyes; and that perhaps their","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,Microscopes did not truly inform them. But they smilingly answered her,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Majesty, That she did not know the vertue of those Microscopes: for they","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"never delude, but rectifie and inform the Senses; nay, the World, said","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"they, would be but blind without them, as it has been in former ages","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,before those Microscopes were invented.,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"After this, they took a Charcoal, and viewing it with one of their best","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Microscopes, discovered in it an infinite multitude of pores, some","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"bigger, some less; so close and thick, that they left but very little","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,space betwixt them to be filled with a solid body; and to give her,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Imperial Majesty a better assurance thereof, they counted in a line of","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"them an inch long, no less then 2700 pores; from which Observation they","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"drew this following Conclusion, to wit, That this multitude of pores was","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"the cause of the blackness of the Coal; for, said they, a body that has","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"so many pores, from each of which no light is reflected, must","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"necessarily look black, since black is nothing else but a privation of","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"light, or a want of reflection. But the Empress replied, That if all","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Colours were made by reflection of light, and that Black was as much a","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,colour as any other colour; then certainly they contradicted themselves,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"in saying that black was made by want of reflection. However, not to","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"interrupt your Microscopical Inspections, said she, let us see how","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Vegetables appear through your Glasses; whereupon they took a Nettle,","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"and by the vertue of the Microscope, discovered that underneath the","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"points of the Nettle there were certain little bags or bladders,","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"containing a poysonous liquor, and when the points had made way into the","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"interior parts of the skin, they like Syringe-pipes served to conveigh","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"that same liquor into them. To which Observation the Empress replied,","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"That if there were such poyson in Nettles, then certainly in eating of","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"them, they would hurt us inwardly, as much as they do outwardly? But","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"they answered, That it belonged to Physicians more then to Experimental","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Philosophers, to give Reasons hereof; for they only made Microscopical","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"inspections, and related the Figures of the Natural parts of Creatures","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,according to the representation of their glasses.,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Lastly, They shewed the Empress a Flea, and a Lowse; which Creatures","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"through the Microscope appear'd so terrible to her sight, that they had","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,almost put her into a swoon; the description of all their parts would be,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"very tedious to relate, and therefore I'le forbear it at this present.","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"The Empress, after the view of those strangely-shaped Creatures, pitied","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"much those that are molested with them, especially poor Beggars, which","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"although they have nothing to live on themselves, are yet necessitated","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"to maintain and feed of their own flesh and blood, a company of such","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"terrible Creatures called Lice; who, instead of thanks, do reward them","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"with pains, and torment them for giving them nourishment and food. But","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"after the Empress had seen the shapes of these monstrous Creatures, she","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"desir'd to know, Whether their Microscopes could hinder their biting, or","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"at least shew some means how to avoid them? To which they answered, That","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,such Arts were mechanical and below the noble study of Microscopical,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"observations. Then the Empress asked them, Whether they had not such","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,sorts of Glasses that could enlarge and magnifie the shapes of great,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,Bodies as well as they had done of little ones? Whereupon they took one,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"of their best and largest Microscopes, and endeavoured to view a Whale","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"thorow it; but alas! the shape of the Whale was so big, that its","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,Circumference went beyond the magnifying quality of the Glass; whether,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"the error proceeded from the Glass, or from a wrong position of the","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Whale against the reflection of light, I cannot certainly tell. The","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Empress seeing the insufficiency of those Magnifying-Glasses, that they","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"were not able to enlarge all sorts of Objects, asked the Bear-men,","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,whether they could not make Glasses of a contrary nature to those they,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"had shewed her, to wit, such as instead of enlarging or magnifying the","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"shape or figure of an Object, could contract it beneath its natural","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"proportion: Which, in obedience to her Majesties Commands, they did; and","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"viewing through one of the best of them, a huge and mighty Whale","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"appear'd no bigger then a Sprat; nay, through some no bigger then a","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Vinegar-Eele; and through their ordinary ones, an Elephant seemed no","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"

,"their great skil, industry and ingenuity in Experimental Philosophy,","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"

,"Syrens- or Fish-men, and the Worm-men, to deliver their Observations","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"which they had made, both within the Seas, and the Earth. First, she","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,enquired of the Fish-men whence the saltness of the Sea did proceed? To,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"which they answered, That there was a volatile salt in those parts of","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"the Earth, which as a bosom contain the Waters of the Sea, which Salt","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"being imbibed by the Sea, became fixt; and this imbibing motion was that","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"they call'd the Ebbing and Flowing of the Sea; for, said they, the","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"rising and swelling of the Water, is caused by those parts of the","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"volatile Salt as are not so easily imbibed, which striving to ascend","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"above the Water, bear it up with such a motion, as Man, or some other","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Animal Creature, in a violent exercise uses to take breath. This they","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"affirmed to be the true cause both of the saltness, and the ebbing and","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"flowing-motion of the Sea, and not the jogging of the Earth, or the","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"secret influence of the Moon, as some others had made the World believe.","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"After this, the Empress enquired, Whether they had observed, that all","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Animal Creatures within the Seas and other waters, had blood? They","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"answered, That some had blood, more or less, but some had none. In","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Crea-fishes and Lobsters, said they, we perceive but little blood; but","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"in Crabs, Oysters, Cockles, &c. none at all. Then the Empress asked","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"them, in what part of their Bodies that little blood did reside? They","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"answered, in a small vein, which in Lobsters went through the middle of","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"their tails, but in Crea-fishes was found in their backs: as for other","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"sorts of Fishes, some, said they, had onely blood about their Gills, and","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,others in some other places of their Bodies; but they had not as yet,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,observed any whose veins did spread all over their Bodies. The Empress,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"wondring that there could be living Animals without Blood, to be better","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"satisfied, desired the Worm-men to inform her, whether they had observed","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Blood in all sorts of Worms? They answered, That, as much as they could","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"perceive, some had Blood, and some not; a Moth, said they, had no Blood","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"at all, and a Lowse had, but like a Lobster, a little Vein along her","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"back: Also Nits, Snails, and Maggots, as well as those that are","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"generated out of Cheese and Fruits, as those that are produced out of","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Flesh, had no blood: But, replied the Empress, If those mentioned","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"creatures have no blood, how is it possible they can live? for it is","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"commonly said, That the life of an Animal consists in the blood, which","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"is the seat of the Animal spirits. They answered, That blood was not a","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,necessary propriety to the life of an Animal; and that that which was,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"commonly called Animal spirits, was nothing else but corporeal motions","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,proper to the nature and figure of an Animal. Then she asked both the,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Fish- and Worm-men, whether all those Creatures that have blood, had a","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"circulation of blood in their veins and arteries? But they answered,","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"That it was impossible to give her Majesty an exact account thereof, by","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"reason the circulation of blood was an interior motion, which their","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"senses, neither of themselves, nor by the help of any Optick Instrument","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"could perceive; but as soon as they had dissected an Animal Creature, to","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"find out the truth thereof, the interior corporeal motions proper to","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"that particular figure or creature, were altered. Then said the Empress,","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"If all Animal Creatures have not blood, it is certain, they all have","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"neither Muscles, tendons, nerves, &c. But, said she, Have you ever","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"observed Animal Creatures that are neither flesh, nor Fish, but of an","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"intermediate degree between both? Truly, answered both the Fish- and","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Worm-men, We have observed several Animal Creatures that live both in","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Water, and on the Earth, indifferently, and if any, certainly those may","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"be said to be of such a mixt nature, that is, partly Flesh, and partly","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Fish: But how is it possible, replied the Empress, that they should live","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"both in Water, and on the Earth, since those Animals that live by the","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"respiration of Air, cannot live within Water; and those that live in","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Water, cannot live by the respiration of Air, as Experience doth","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"sufficiently witness. They answered her Majesty, That as there were","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"different sorts of Creatures, so they had also different ways of","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Respirations; for Respiration, said they, is nothing else but a","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"composition and division of parts, and the motions of nature being","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"infinitely various, it is impossible that all Creatures should have the","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"like motions; wherefore it was not necessary, that all Animal Creatures","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"should be bound to live either by the Air, or by Water onely, but","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,according as Nature had ordered it convenient to their Species. The,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Empress seem'd very well satisfied with their answer, and desired to be","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"further informed, Whether all Animal Creatures did continue their","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Species by a successive propogation of particulars, and whether in every","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Species the off-springs did always resemble their Generator or Producer,","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"both in their interior and exterior Figures? They answered, her Majesty,","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"That some Species or sorts of Creatures, were kept up by a successive","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"propagation of an off-spring that was like the producer, but some were","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"not. Of the first rank, said they, are all those Animals that are of","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"different sexes, besides several others; but of the second rank are for","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"the most part those we call Insects, whose production proceds from such","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,causes as have no conformity or likeness with their produced Effects; as,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"for example, Maggots bred out of Cheese, and several others generated","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"out of Earth, Water, and the like. But said the Empress, there is some","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"likeness between Maggots and Cheese; for Cheese has no blood, nor","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Maggots neither; besides, they have almost the same taste which Cheese","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"has. This proves nothing, answered they; for Maggots have a visible,","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"local, progressive motion, which Cheese hath not. The Empress replied,","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"That when all the Cheese was turned into Maggots, it might be said to","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"have local, progressive motion. They answered, That when the Cheese by","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"its own figurative motions was changed into Maggots, it was no more","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,Cheese. The Empress confessed that she observed Nature was infinitely,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"various in her works, and that though the species of Creatures did","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"continue, yet their particulars were subject to infinite changes. But","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"since you have informed me, said she, of the various sorts and","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"productions of Animal Creatures, I desire you to tell me what you have","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"observed of their sensitive perceptions? Truly, answered they, Your","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Majesty puts a very hard question to us, and we shall hardly be able to","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,give a satisfactory answer to it; for there are many different sorts of,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Creatures, which as they have all different perceptions, so they have","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"also different organs, which our senses are not able to discover, onely","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"in an Oystershell we have with admiration observed, that the common","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"sensorium of the Oyster lies just as the closing of the shells, where","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,the pressure and re-action may be perceived by the opening and shutting,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,of the shells every tide.,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"After all this, the Empress desired the Worm men to give her a true","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Relation how frost was made upon the Earth? To which they answered, That","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,it was made much after the manner and description of the Fish- and,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Bird-men, concerning the Congelation of Water into Ice and Snow, by a","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,commixture of saline and acid particles; which relation added a great,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"light to the Ape-men, who were the Chymists, concerning their Chymical","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"principles, Salt, Sulphur, and Mercury. But, said the Empress, if it be","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"so, it will require an infinite multitude of saline particles to produce","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"such a great quantity of Ice, Frost and Snow: besides, said she, when","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Snow, Ice and Frost, turn again into their former principle, I would","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,fain know what becomes of those saline particles? But neither the,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Worm-men, nor the Fish- and Bird-men, could give her an answer to it.","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Then the Empress enquired of them the reason, Why Springs were not as","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"salt as the Sea is? also, why some did ebb and flow? To which it was","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"answered, That the ebbing and flowing of some Springs, was caused by","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"hollow Caverns within the Earth, where the Seawater crowding thorow, did","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"thrust forward, and drew backward the Spring-water, according to its own","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"way of ebbing and flowing; but others said, That it proceeded from a","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"small proportion of saline and acid particles, which the Spring-water","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,imbibed from the Earth; and although it was not so much as to be,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,perceived by the sense of Taste; yet it was enough to cause an ebbing,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"and flowing-motion. And as for the Spring- water being fresh, they gave,","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"according to their Observation, this following reason: There is, said","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"they, a certain heat within the Bowels of the Earth, proceeding from its","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"swift circular motion, upon its own axe, which heat distills the rarest","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"parts of the Earth into a fresh and insipid water, which water being","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"through the pores of the Earth, conveighed into a place where it may","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"break forth without resistance or obstruction, causes Springs and","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Fountains; and these distilled Waters within the Earth, do nourish and","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,refresh the grosser and drier parts thereof. This Relation confirmed the,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Empress in the opinion concerning the motion of the Earth, and the","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"fixedness of the Sun, as the Bird-men had informed her; and then she","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"asked the Worm-men, whether Minerals and Vegetables were generated by","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,the same heat that is within the Bowels of the Earth? To which they,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"could give her no positive answer; onely this they affirmed, That heat","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,and cold were not the primary producing causes of either Vegetables or,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Minerals, or other sorts of Creatures, but onely effects; and to prove","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"this our assertion, said they, we have observed, that by change of some","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"sorts of Corporeal motions, that which is now hot, will become cold; and","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"what is now cold, will grow hot; but the hottest place of all, we find","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"to be the Center of the Earth: Neither do we observe, that the Torrid","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,Zone does contain so much Gold and Silver as the Temperate; nor is there,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,great store of Iron and Lead wheresoever there is Gold; for these Metals,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,are most found in colder Climates towards either of the Poles. This,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Observation, the Empress commanded them to confer with her Chymists, the","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Ape-men; to let them know that Gold was not produced by a violent, but a","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"temperate degree of heat. She asked further, Whether Gold could not be","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"made by Art? They answered, That they could not certainly tell her","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Majesty, but if it was possible to be done, they thought Tin, Lead,","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Brass, Iron and Silver, to be the fittest Metals for such an Artificial","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Transmutation. Then she asked them, Whether Art could produce Iron, Tin,","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Lead, or Silver? They answered, Not, in their opinion. Then I perceive,","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"replyed the Empress, that your judgments are very irregular, since you","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"believe that Gold, which is so fixt a Metal, that nothing has been found","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"as yet which could occasion a dissolution of its interior figure, may be","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"made by Art, and not Tin, Lead, Iron, Copper or Silver, which yet are so","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"far weaker, and meaner Metals then Gold is. But the Worm-men excused","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"themselves, that they were ignorant in that Art, and that such questions","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"belonged more properly to the Ape-men, which were Her Majesties Chymists.","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Then the Empress asked them, Whether by their Sensitive perceptions they","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"could observe the interior corporeal, figurative Motions both of","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Vegetables and Minerals? They answer'd, That their Senses could perceive","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"them after they were produced, but not before; Nevertheless, said they,","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"although the interior, figurative motions of Natural Creatures are not","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"subject to the exterior, animal, sensitive perceptions, yet by their","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Rational perception they may judg of them, and of their productions if","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,they be regular: Whereupon the Empress commanded the Bear-men to lend,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,them some of their best Microscopes. At which the Bear- men smilingly,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"answered her Majesty, that their Glasses would do them but little","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"service in the bowels of the Earth, because there was no light; for,","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"said they, our Glasses do onely represent exterior objects, according to","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,the various reflections and positions of light; and wheresoever light is,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"wanting, the glasses wil do no good. To which the Worm-men replied, that","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"although they could not say much of refractions, reflections,","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"inflections, and the like; yet were they not blind, even in the bowels","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"of the Earth: for they could see the several sorts of Minerals, as also","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"minute Animals, that lived there; which minute Animal Creatures were not","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"blind neither, but had some kind of sensitive perception that was as","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"serviceable to them, as sight, taste, smell, touch, hearing, &c. was to","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"other Animal Creatures: By which it is evident, That Nature has been as","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"bountiful to those Creatures that live underground, or in the bowels of","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"the Earth, as to those that live upon the surface of the Earth, or in","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"the Air, or in Water. But howsoever, proceeded the Worm-men, although","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"there is light in the bowels of the Earth, yet your Microscopes will do","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"but little good there, by reason those Creatures that live under ground","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,have not such an optick sense as those that live on the surface of the,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Earth: wherefore, unless you had such Glasses as are proper for their","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"perception, your Microscopes will not be any ways advantagious to them.","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,The Empress seem'd well pleased with this answer of the Worm-men; and,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"asked them further, Whether Minerals and all other Creatures within the","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,Earth were colourless? At which question they could not forbear,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,laughing; and when the Empress asked the reason why they laught? We most,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"humbly beg your Majesties pardon, replied they; for we could not chuse","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"but laugh, when we heard of a colourless Body. Why, said the Empress,","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Colour is onely an accident, which is an immaterial thing, and has no","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"being of it self, but in another body. Those, replied they, that","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"informed your Majesty thus, surely their rational motions were very","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"irregular; For how is it possible, that a Natural nothing can have a","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"being in Nature? If it be no substance, it cannot have a being, and if","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"no being, it is nothing; Wherefore the distinction between subsisting of","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"it self, and subsisting in another body, is a meer nicety, and","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"non-sense, for there is nothing in Nature that can subsist of, or by it","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"self, (I mean singly) by reason all parts of Nature are composed in one","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"body, and though they may be infinitely divided, commixed, and changed","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"in their particular, yet in general, parts cannot be separated from","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"parts as long as Nature lasts; nay, we might as probably affirm, that","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Infinite Nature would be as soon destroyed, as that one Atom could","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"perish; and therefore your Majesty may firmly believe, that there is no","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Body without colour, nor no Colour without body; for colour, figure,","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"place, magnitude, and body, are all but one thing, without any","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,separation or abstraction from each other.,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,The Empress was so wonderfully taken with this Discourse of the,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Worm-men, that she not only pardoned the rudeness they committed in","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"laughing at first at her question, but yielded a full assent to their","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"opinion, which she thought the most rational that ever she had heard","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"yet; and then proceeding in her questions, enquired further, whether","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,they had observed any seminal principles within the Earth free from all,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"dimensions and qualities, which produced Vegetables, Minerals, and the","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"like? To which they answered, That concerning the seeds of Minerals,","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,their sensitive perceptions had never observed any; but Vegetables had,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"certain seeds out of which they were produced. Then she asked, whether","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"those seeds of Vegetables lost their Species, that is, were annihilated","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"in the production of their off-spring? To which they answered, That by","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"an Annihilation, nothing could be produced, and that the seeds of","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Vegetables were so far from being annihilated in their productions, that","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,they did rather numerously increase and multiply; for the division of,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"one seed, said they, does produce numbers of seeds out of it self. But","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"repli'd the Empress, A particular part cannot increase of it self. 'Tis","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"true, answer'd they: but they increase not barely of themselves, but by","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"joining and commixing with other parts, which do assist them in their","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"productions, and by way of imitation form or figure their own parts into","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"such or such particulars. Then, I pray inform me, said the Empress, what","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"disguise those seeds put on, and how they do conceal themselves in their","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Transmutations? They answered, That seeds did no ways disguise or","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"conceal, but rather divulge themselves in the multiplication of their","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,off-spring; onely they did hide and conceal themselves from their,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"sensitive perceptions so, that their figurative and productive motions","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"were not perceptible by Animal Creatures. Again, the Empress asked them,","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,whether there were any Non-beings within the Earth? To which they,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"answered, That they never heard of any such thing; and that, if her","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Majesty would know the truth thereof, she must ask those Creatures that","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"are called Immaterial spirits, which had a great affinity with","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Non-beings, and perhaps could give her a satisfactory answer to this","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"question. Then she desired to be informed, What opinion they had of the","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"beginning of Forms? They told her Majesty, That they did not understand","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"what she meant by this expression; For, said they, there is no beginning","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"in Nature, no not of Particulars; by reason Nature is Eternal and","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Infinite, and her particulars are subject to infinite changes and","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"transmutations by vertue of their own Corporeal, figurative","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"self-motions; so that there's nothing new in Nature, not properly a","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,beginning of any thing. The Empress seem'd well satisfied with all those,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"answers, and enquired further, Whether there was no Art used by those","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Creatures that live within the Earth? Yes, answered they: for the","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,several parts of the Earth do join and assist each other in composition,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"or framing of such or such particulars; and many times, there are","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"factions and divisions; which cause productions of mixt Species; as, for","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"example, weeds, instead of sweet flowres and useful fruits; but","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Gardeners and Husbandmen use often to decide their quarrels, and cause","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"them to agree; which though it shews a kindness to the differing parties,","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"yet 'tis a great prejudice to the Worms, and other Animal-Creatures","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,that live under ground; for it most commonly causes their dissolution,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"and ruine, at best they are driven out of their habitations. What, said","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"the Empress, are not Worms produced out of the Earth? Their production","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"in general, answered they, is like the production of all other Natural","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Creatures, proceeding from the corporeal figurative motions of Nature;","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"but as for their particular productions, they are according to the","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"nature of their Species; some are produced out of flowers, some out","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"of roots, some out of fruits, some out of ordinary Earth. Then they","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"are very ungrateful Children, replied the Empress, that they feed on","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"their own Parents which gave them life. Their life, answered they, is","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"their own, and not their Parents; for no part or creature of Nature can","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,either give or take away life; but parts do onely assist and join with,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"parts, either in dissolution or production of other Parts and Creatures.","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"After this, and several other Conferences, which the Empress held with","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"the Worm-men, she dismissed them; and having taken much satisfaction in","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"several of their Answers, encouraged them in their Studies and","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Observations. Then she made a Convocation of her Chymists, the Ape-men;","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,and commanded them to give her an account of the several Transmutations,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,which their Art was able to produce. They begun first with a long and,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,tedious Discourse concerning the Primitive Ingredients of Natural,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"bodies; and how, by their Art, they had found out the principles out of","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,which they consist. But they did not all agree in their opinions; for,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"some said, That the Principles of all Natural Bodies were the four","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Elements, Fire, Air, Water, Earth, out of which they were composed:","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Others rejected this Elementary commixture, and said, There were many","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,Bodies out of which none of the four Elements could be extracted by any,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"degree of Fire whatsoever; and that, on the other side, there were","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"divers Bodies, whose resolution by Fire reduced them into more then four","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"different Ingredients; and these affirmed, That the only principles of","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Natural Bodies were Salt, Sulphur, and Mercury: Others again declared,","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,That none of the forementioned could be called the True Principles of,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,Natural Bodies; but that by their industry and pains which they had,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"taken in the Art of Chymistry, they had discovered, that all Natural","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Bodies were produced but from one Principle, which was Water; for all","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Vegetables, Minerals, and Animals, said they, are nothing else, but","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,simple Water distinguished into various figures by the vertue of their,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,Seeds. But after a great many debates and contentions about this,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Subject, the Empress being so much tired that she was not able to hear","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"them any longer, imposed a general silence upon them, and then declared","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,her self in this following Discourse.,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"I am too sensible of the pains you have taken in the Art of Chymistry,","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"to discover the Principles of Natural Bodies, and wish they had been","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"more profitably bestowed upon some other, then such experiments; for","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"both by my own Contemplation, and the Observations which I have made by","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"my rational & sensitive perception upon Nature, and her works, I find,","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"that Nature is but one Infinite Self-moving Body, which by the vertue of","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"its self-motion, is divided into Infinite parts, which parts being","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"restless, undergo perpetual changes and transmutations by their infinite","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"compositions and divisions. Now, if this be so, as surely, according to","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"regular Sense and Reason, it appears no otherwise; it is in vain to look","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"for primary Ingredients, or constitutive principles of Natural Bodies,","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"since there is no more but one Universal Principle of Nature, to wit,","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"self-moving Matter, which is the onely cause of all natural effects.","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Next, I desire you to consider, that Fire is but a particular Creature,","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"or effect of Nature, and occasions not onely different effects in","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"several Bodies, but on some Bodies has no power at all; witness Gold,","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,which never could be brought yet to change its interior figure by the,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"art of Fire; and if this be so, Why should you be so simple as to","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,believe that Fire can shew you the Principles of Nature? and that either,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"the Four Elements, or Water onely, or Salt Sulphur and Mercury, all","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"which are no more but particular effects and Creatures of Nature, should","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,be the Primitive Ingredients or Principles of all Natural Bodies?,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Wherefore, I will not have you to take more pains, and waste your time","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"in such fruitless attempts, but be wiser hereafter, and busie your","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,selves with such Experiments as may be beneficial to the publick.,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"The Empress having thus declared her mind to the Ape-men, and given them","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"better Instructions then perhaps they expected, not knowing that her","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Majesty had such great and able judgment in Natural Philosophy, had","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"several conferences with them concerning Chymical Preperations, which","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"for brevities sake, I'le forbear to reherse: Amongst the rest, she","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"asked, how it came that the Imperial Race appear'd so young, and yet was","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"reported to have lived so long; some of them two, some three, and some","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"four hundred years? and whether it was by Nature, or a special Divine","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"blessing? To which they answered, That there was a certain Rock in the","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"parts of that World, which contained the Golden Sands, which Rock was","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"hallow within, and did produce a Gum that was a hundred years before it","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"came to its full strength and perfection; this Gum, said they, if it be","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"held in a warm hand, will dissolve into an Oyl, the effects whereof are","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"following: It being given every day for some certain time, to an old","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"decayed man, in the bigness of a little Pea, will first make him spit","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"for a week, or more; after this, it will cause Vomits of Flegm; and","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"after that it will bring forth by vomits, humors of several colours;","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"first of a pale yellow, then of a deep yellow, then of a green, and","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,lastly of a black colour; and each of these humours have a several,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"taste, some are fresh, some salt, some sower, some bitter, and so forth;","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"neither do all these Vomits make them sick, but they come out on a","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"sudden, and unawares, without any pain or trouble to the patient: And","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"after it hath done all these mentioned effects, and clear'd both the","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Stomack and several other parts of the body, then it works upon the","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Brain, and brings forth of the Nose such kinds of humors as it did out","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"of the Mouth, and much after the same manner; then it will purge by","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"stool, then by urine, then by sweat, and lastly by bleeding at the Nose,","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,and the Emeroids; all which effects it will perform within the space of,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"six weeks, or a little more; for it does not work very strongly, but","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"gently, and by degrees: Lastly, when it has done all this, it will make","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"the body break out into a thick Scab, and cause both Hair, Teeth, and","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Nails to come off; which scab being arrived to its full maturity, opens","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"first along the back, and comes off all in a piece like armour, and all","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,this is done within the space of four months. After this the Patient is,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"wrapt into a Cere- cloth, prepared of certain Gums and Juices, wherein","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"

,"recreations are many, but chiefly Hunting.","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,This Relation amazed the Empress very much; for though in the World she,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"came from, she had heard great reports of the Philosophers-stone, yet","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"had she not heard of any that had ever found it out, which made her","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"believe that it was but a Chymera; she called also to mind, that there","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,had been in the same World a Man who had a little Stone which cured all,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"

,"a famous Chymist had found out a certain Liquor called Alkahest, which","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"by the vertue of its own fire, consumed all Diseases; but she had never","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"heard of a Medicine that could renew old Age, and render it beautiful,","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"vigorous and strong: Nor would she have so easily believed it, had it","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"been a medicine prepared by Art; for she knew that Art, being Natures","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Changeling, was not able to produce such a powerful effect; but being","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"that the Gum did grow naturally, she did not so much scruple at it; for","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"

,,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"The Conferences of the Chymists being finished, the Empress made an","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Assembly of her Galenical Physicians, her Herbalists and Anatomists; and","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,first she enquired of her Herbalists the particular effects of several,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Herbs and Drugs, and whence they proceeded? To which they answered, that","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"they could, for the most part, tell her Majesty the vertues and","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"operations of them, but the particular causes of their effects were","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"unknown; onely thus much they could say, that their operations and","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"vertues were generally caused by their proper inherent, corporeal,","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"figurative motions, which being infinitely various in Infinite Nature,","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"did produce infinite several effects. And it is observed, said they,","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"that Herbs and Drugs are as wise in their operations, as Men in their","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"words and actions; nay, wiser; and their effects are more certain then","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Men in their opinions; for though they cannot discourse like Men, yet","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"have they Sense and Reason, as well as Men; for the discursive faculty","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,is but a particular effect of Sense and Reason in some particular,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Creatures, to wit, Men, and not a principle of Nature, and argues often","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"more folly then wisdom. The Empress asked, Whether they could not by a","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,composition and commixture of other Drugs make them work other effects,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"then they did, used by themselves? They answered, That they could make","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"

,and particular natures.,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,Then the Empress commanded her Anatomists to dissect such kinds of,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Creatures as are called Monsters. But they answered her Majesty, That it","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"

,"imployments; for when we dissect dead Animals, said they, it is for no","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"other end, but to observe what defects and distempers they had, that we","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"may cure the like in living ones, so that all our care and industry","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,concerns onely the preservation of Mankind; but we hope your Majesty,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"will not preserve Monsters, which are most commonly destroyed, except it","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,be for novelty: Neither will the dissection of Monsters prevent the,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"errors of Nature's irregular actions; for by dissecting some, we cannot","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,prevent the production of others; so that our pains and labour will be,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"to no purpose, unless to satisfie the vain curiosities of inquisitive","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"men. The Empress replied, That such dissections would be very beneficial","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"to Experimental Philosophers. If Experimental Philosophers, answer'd","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"they, do spend their time in such useless Inspections, they waste it in","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"

,"Lastly, her Majesty had some Conferences with the Galenick Physicians","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"about several Diseases, and amongst the rest, desired to know the cause","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"and nature of Apoplexies, and the spotted Plague. They answered, That a","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"deadly Apoplexy was a dead palsie of the Brain, and the spotted Plague","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,was a Gangrene of the Vital parts: and as the Gangrene of outward parts,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"did strike inwardly; so the Gangrene of inward parts, did break forth","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"outwardly: which is the cause, said they, that as soon as the spots","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"appear, death follows; for then it is an infallible sign, that the body","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"is throughout infected with a Gangrene, which is a spreading evil; but","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"some Gangrenes do spread more suddenly than others, and of all sorts of","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Gangrenes, the Plaguy- Gangrene is the most infectious; for other","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Gangrenes infect but the next adjoining parts of one particular body,","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"and having killed that same Creature, go no further, but cease; when as,","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"the Gangrene of the Plague, infects not onely the adjoining parts of one","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"particular Creature, but also those that are distant; that is, one","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"particular body infects another, and so breeds a Universal Contagion.","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,But the Empress being very desirous to know in what manner the Plague,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"was propagated, and became so contagious, asked, Whether it went","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"actually out of one body into another? To which they answered, That it","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"was a great dispute amongst the Learned of their Profession, Whether it","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"came by a division and composition of parts; that is, by expiration and","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,inspiration; or whether it was caused by imitation: some Experimental,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Philosophers, said they, will make us believe, that by the help of their","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Microscopes, they have observed the Plague to be a body of little Flies","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"like Atoms, which go out of one body into another, through the sensitive","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"passages; but the most experienced and wisest of our society, have","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"rejected this opinion as a ridiculous fancy, and do, for the most part,","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"believe, that it is caused by an imitation of Parts; so that the motions","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"of some parts which are sound, do imitate the motions of those that are","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"

,,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,The Empress having hitherto spent her time in the Examination of the,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Bird- Fish- Worm- and Ape- men, &c. and received several Intelligences","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,from their several imployments; at last had a mind to divert her self,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"after her serious Discourses, and therefore she sent for the Spider-men,","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"which were her Mathematicians, the Lice-men which were here","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Geometricians, and the Magpie- Parrot- and Jackdaw-men, which were her","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Orators and Logicians. The Spider-men came first, and presented her","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Majesty with a table full of Mathematical points, lines, and figures of","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"all sorts, of squares, circles, triangles, and the like; which the","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Empress, notwithstanding that she had a very ready wit, and quick","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"apprehension, could not understand; but the more she endeavoured to","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"learn, the more was she confounded: Whether they did ever square the","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Circle, I cannot exactly tell, nor whether they could make imaginary","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"points and lines; but this I dare say, That their points and lines were","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"so slender, small and thin, that they seem'd next to Imaginary. The","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Mathematicians were in great esteem with the Empress, as being not onely","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"the chief Tutors and Instructors in many Arts, but some of them","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"excellent Magicians and Informers of spirits, which was the reason their","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Characters were so abstruse and intricate, that the Emperess knew not","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"what to make of them. There is so much to learn in your Art, said she,","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,that I can neither spare time from other affairs to busie my self in,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"

,"Then came the Lice-men, and endeavoured to measure all things to a","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"hairs-breadth, and weigh them to an Atom; but their weights would seldom","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"agree, especially in the weighing of Air, which they found a task","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"impossible to be done; at which the Empress began to be displeased, and","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"told them, that there was neither Truth nor Justice in their Profession;","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,and so dissolved their society.,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"After this, the Empress was resolved to hear the Magpie- Parrot- and","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Jackdaw-men, which were her professed Orators and Logicians; whereupon","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"one of the Parrot-men rose with great formality, and endeavoured to make","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"an Eloquent Speech before her Majesty; but before he had half ended, his","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"arguments and divisions being so many, that they caused a great","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"confusion in his brain, he could not go forward, but was forced to","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"retire backward, with great disgrace both to himself, and the whole","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,society; and although one of his brethren endeavoured to second him by,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"another speech, yet was he as far to seek, as the former. At which the","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Empress appear'd not a little troubled, and told them, That they","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"followed too much the Rules of Art, and confounded themselves with too","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"nice formalities and distinctions; but since I know, said she, that you","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"are a people who have naturally voluble tongues, and good memories; I","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"desire you to consider more the subject you speak of, then your","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"

,"Lastly, her Imperial Majesty being desirous to know what progress her","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Logicians had made in the Art of disputing, Commanded them to argue upon","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,several Themes or Subjects; which they did; and having made a very nice,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"discourse of Logistical terms and propositions, entred into a dispute by","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"way of Syllogistical Arguments, through all the Figures and Modes: One","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"began with an Argument of the first Mode of the first Figure, thus:","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Every Politician is wise: Every Knave is a Politician, Therefore every","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,Knave is wise.,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,Another contradicted him with a Syllogism of the second Mode of the same,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Figure, thus: No Politician is wise: Every Knave is a Politician,","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,Therefore no Knave is wise.,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"The third made an Argument in the third Mode of the same Figure, after","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"this manner: Every Politician is wise: some Knaves are Politicians,","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,Therefore some Knaves are wise.,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,The Fourth concluded with a Syllogism in the fourth Mode of the same,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Figure, thus; No Politician is wise: some Knaves are Politicians,","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,Therefore some Knaves are not wise.,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"After this they took another subject, and one propounded this Syllogism:","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Every Philosopher is wise: Every Beast is wise, Therefore every Beast is","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,a Philosopher.,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"But another said that this Argument was false, therefore he contradicted","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"him with a Syllogism of the second Figure of the fourth Mode, thus:","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Every Philosopher is wise: some Beasts are not wise, Therefore some","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,Beasts are not Philosophers.,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"

,"Thus they argued, and intended to go on, but the Empress interrupted","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"them: I have enough, said she, of your chopt Logick, and will hear no","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"more of your Syllogisms; for it disorders my Reason, and puts my Brain","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,on the rack; your formal argumentations are able to spoil all natural,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"wit; and I'le have you to consider, that Art does not make Reason, but","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Reason makes Art; and therefore as much as Reason is above Art, so much","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,is a natural rational discourse to be preferred before an artificial:,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"for Art is, for the most part irregular, and disorders Men's","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"understandings more then it rectifies them, and leads them into a","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Labyrinth where they'l never get out, and makes them dull and unfit for","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"useful employments; especially your Art of Logick, which consists onely","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"in contradicting each other, in making sophismes, and obscuring Truth,","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,instead of clearing it.,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"But they replied to her Majesty, That the knowledg of Nature, that is,","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Natural Philosophy, would be imperfect without the Art of Logick; and","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,that there was an improbable Truth which could no otherwise be found out,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"then by the Art of disputing. Truly, said the Empress, I do believe that","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"it is with Natural Philosophy, as it is with all other effects of","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Nature; for no particular knowledg can be perfect, by reason knowledg is","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"dividable, as well as composable; nay, to speak properly, Nature her","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"self cannot boast of any perfection, but God himself; because there are","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"so many irregular motions in Nature, and 'tis but a folly to think that","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Art should be able to regulate them, since Art it self is, for the most","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"part, irregular. But as for Improbable Truth I know not what your","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"meaning is; for Truth is more then Improbability: nay, there is so much","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"difference between Truth and Improbability, that I cannot conceive it","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"possible how they can be joined together. In short, said she, I do no","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,ways approve of your Profession; and though I will not dissolve your,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"society, yet I shall never take delight in hearing you any more;","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"wherefore confine your disputations to your Schools, lest besides the","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Commonwealth of Learning, they disturb also Divinity and Policy,","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"

,After the Empress had thus finish'd the Discourses and Conferences with,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"the mentioned societies of her Vertuoso's, she considered by her self","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"the manner of their Religion, and finding it very defective, was","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"troubled, that so wise and knowing a people should have no more knowledg","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"of the Divine Truth; Wherefore she consulted with her own thoughts,","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"whether it was possible to convert them all to her own Religion, and to","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"that end she resolved to build Churches, and make also up a Congregation","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"of Women, whereof she intended to be the head her self, and to instruct","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,them in the several points of her Religion. This she had no sooner,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"begun, but the Women, which generally had quick wits, subtile","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"conceptions, clear understandings, and solid judgments, became, in a","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"short time, very devout and zealous Sisters; for the Empress had an","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"excellent gift of Preaching, and instructing them in the Articles of","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Faith; and by that means, she converted them not onely soon, but gained","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,an extraordinary love of all her Subjects throughout that World. But at,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"last, pondering with her self the inconstant nature of Mankind, and","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"fearing that in time they would grow weary, and desert the divine Truth,","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"following their own fancies, and living according to their own desires;","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,she began to be troubled that her labours and pains should prove of so,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"little effect, and therefore studied all manner of ways to prevent it.","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Amongst the rest, she call'd to mind a Relation which the Bird-men made","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"her once, of a Mountain that did burn in flames of fire; and thereupon","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"did immediately send for the wisest and subtilest of her Worm-men,","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,commanding them to discover the cause of the Eruption of that same fire;,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"which they did; and having dived to the very bottom of the Mountain,","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"informed her Majesty, That there was a certain sort of Stone, whose","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"nature was such, that being wetted, it would grow excessively hot, and","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"break forth into a flaming-fire, until it became dry, and then it ceased","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"from burning. The Empress was glad to hear this news, and forthwith","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"desired the Worm men to bring her some of that Stone, but be sure to","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"keep it secret: she sent also for the Bird-men, and asked them whether","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"they could not get her a piece of the Sun- stone? They answered, That it","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"was impossible, unless they did spoil or lessen the light of the World:","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"but, said they, if it please your Majesty, we can demolish one of the","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"

,"The Empress was very well satisfied with this proposal, and having thus","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"imployed these two sorts of men, in the mean while builded two Chappels","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"one above another; the one she lined throughout with Diamonds, both","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Roof, Walls and Pillars; but the other she resolved to line with the","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"

,and were troubled at their own wickedness: Neither did the heat of the,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,flame in the least hinder her; for the Fire-stone did not cast so great,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"a heat but the Empress was able to endure it, by reason the water which","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"was poured on the Stone, by its own self-motion turned into a","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"flaming-fire, occasioned by the natural motions of the Stone, which made","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,the flame weaker then if it had been fed by some other kind of fuel; the,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"other Chappel where the Star-Stone was, although it did cast a great","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"light, yet was it without all heat, and the Empress appear'd like an","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Angel in it; and as that Chappel was an embleme of Hell, so this was an","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"embleme of Heaven. And thus the Empress, by Art, and her own Ingenuity,","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"did not onely convert the Blazing-World to her own Religion, but kept","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"them in a constant belief, without inforcement or blood-shed; for she","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"knew well, that belief was a thing not to be forced or pressed upon the","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"people, but to be instilled into their minds by gentle perswasions; and","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,after this manner she encouraged them also in all other duties and,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"employments: for Fear, though it makes people obey, yet does it not last","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"so long, nor is it so sure a means to keep them to their duties, as Love.","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Last of all, when she saw that both Church and State now in a","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"well-ordered and setled condition, her thoughts reflected upon the World","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,she came from; and though she had a great desire to know the condition,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"of the same, yet could she advise no manner of way how to gain any","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"knowledg thereof; at last, after many serious considerations, she","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"conceived that it was impossible to be done by any other means, then by","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,the help of Immaterial Spirits; wherefore she made a Convocation of the,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"most learned, witty and ingenious of all the forementioned sorts of Men,","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"and desired to know of them, whether there were any Immaterial Spirits","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"in their World. First, she enquired of the Worm-men, whether they had","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"perceived some within the Earth? They answered her Majesty, That they","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,never knew of any such Creatures; for whatsoever did dwell within the,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Earth, said they, was imbodied and material. Then she asked the Fly-men,","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"whether they had observed any in the Air? for you having numerous Eyes,","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"said she, will be more able to perceive them, than any other Creatures.","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"To which they answered her Majesty, That although Spirits, being","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"immaterial, could not be perceived by the Worm-men in the Earth, yet","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,they perceived that such Creatures did lodg in the Vehicles of the Air.,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Then the Empress asked, Whether they could speak to them, and whether","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"they did understand each other? The Fly-men answered, That those Spirits","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,were always cloth'd in some sort or other of Material Garments; which,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Garments were their Bodies, made, for the most part, of Air; and when","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"occasion served, they could put on any other sort of substances; but yet","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"they could not put these substances into any form or shape, as they","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"pleased. The Empress asked the Fly-men, whether it was possible that she","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"could be acquainted, and have some conferences with them?","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"They answered, They did verily believe she might. Hereupon the Empress","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"commanded the Fly-men to ask some of the Spirits, Whether they would be","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,pleased to give her a Visit? This they did; and after the Spirits had,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"presented themselves to the Empress, (in what shapes and forms, I cannot","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"exactly tell) after some few Complements that passed between them, the","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Empress told the Spirits that she questioned not, but they did know how","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"she was a stranger in that World, and by what miraculous means she was","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,arrived there; and since she had a great desire to know the condition of,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"the World she came from, her request to the Spirits was, To give her","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"some Information thereof, especially of those parts of the World where","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"she was born, bred, and educated; as also of her particular friends and","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"acquaintance: all which, the Spirits did according to her desire. At","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"last, after a great many conferences and particular intelligences, which","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"the Spirits gave the Empress, to her great satisfaction and content; she","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"enquired after the most famous Students, Writers, and Experimental","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Philosophers in that World, which they gave her full relation of:","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"amongst the rest she enquired, Whether there were none that had found","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"out yet the Jews Cabbala? Several have endeavoured it, answered the","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Spirits, but those that came nearest (although themselves denied it)","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"were one Dr. Dee, and one Edward Kelly, the one representing Moses, and","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"the other Aaron; for Kelly was to Dr. Dee, as Aaron to Moses; but yet","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,they proved at last but meer Cheats; and were described by one of their,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"own Country-men, a famous Poet, named Ben. Johnson, in a Play call'd, The","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Alchymist, where he expressed Kelly by Capt. Face, and Dee by Dr.","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Subtle, and their two Wives by Doll Common, and the Widow; by the","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Spaniard the Play, he meant the Spanish Ambassador, and by Sir Epicure","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Mammon, a Polish Lord. The Empress remembred that she had seen the Play,","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"and asked the Spirits, whom he meant by the name of Ananias? some","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Zealous Brethren, answered they, in Holland, Germany, and several other","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"places. Then she asked them, Who was meant by the Druggist? Truly,","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"answered the Spirits, We have forgot, it being so long since it was made","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"and acted. What, replied the Empress, Can Spirits forget? Yes, said the","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Spirits; for what is past, is onely kept in memory, if it be not","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"recorded. I did believe, said the Empress, That Spirits had no need of","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Memory, or Remembrance, and could not be subject to Forgetfulness. How","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"can we, answered they, give an account of things present, if we had no","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Memory, but especially of things past, unrecorded, if we had no","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Remembrance? said the Empress, By present Knowledg and Understanding.","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"The Spirits answered, That present Knowledg and Understanding was of","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"actions or things present, not of past. But, said the Empress, you know","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"what is to come, without Memory or Remembrance; and therefore you may","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"know what is past without memory and remembrance. They answered, That","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,their foreknowledg was onely a prudent and subtile Observation made by,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"comparing of things or actions past, with those that are present; and","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,that Remembrance was nothing else but a Repetition of things or actions,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,past.,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Then the Empress asked the Spirits, Whether there was a threefold","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Cabbala? They answered, Dee and Kelly made but a two-fold Cabbala, to","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"wit, of the Old and New Testament, but others might not onely make two","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"or three, but threescore Cabbala's, if they pleased. The Empress asked,","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Whether it was a Traditional, or meerly a Scriptural, or whether it was","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"a Literal, Philosophical, or Moral Cabbala some, answered they, did","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"believe it meerly Traditional, others Scriptural, some Literal, and some","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Metaphorical: but the truth is, said they, 'twas partly one, and partly","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"the other; as partly a Traditional, partly a Scriptural, partly Literal,","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"partly Metaphorical. The Empress asked further, Whether the Cabbala was","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"a work onely of Natural Reason, or of Divine Inspiration? Many, said the","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Spirits, that write Cabbala's pretend to Divine Inspirations; but","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"whether it be so, or not, it does not belong to us to judg; onely this","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"we must needs confess, that it is a work which requires a good wit, and","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"a strong Faith, but not Natural Reason; for though Natural Reason is","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"most perswasive, yet Faith is the chief that is required in Cabbalists.","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"But, said the Empress, Is there not Divine Reason, as well as there is","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Natural? No, answered they: for there is but a Divine Faith, and as for","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,Reason it is onely Natural; but you Mortals are so puzled about this,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Divine Faith, and Natural Reason, that you do not know well how to","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"distinguish them, but confound them both, which is the cause you have so","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,many divine Philosophers who make a Gallimafry both of Reason and Faith.,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Then she asked, Whether pure Natural Philosophers were Cabbalists? They","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"answered, No; but onely your Mystical or Divine Philosophers, such as","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"study beyond Sense and Reason. she enquired further, Whether there was","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"any Cabbala in God, or whether God was full of Idea's? They answered,","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"There could be nothing in God, nor could God be full of any thing,","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"either forms or figures, but of himself; for God is the Perfection of","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"all things, and an Unexpressible Being, beyond the conception of any","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Creature, either Natural or Supernatural. Then I pray inform me, said","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"the Empress, Whether the Jews Cabbala or any other, consist in Numbers?","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"The Spirits answered, No: for Numbers are odd, and different, and would","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"make a disagreement in the Cabbala. But, said she again, Is it a sin","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"then not to know or understand the Cabbala? God is so merciful, answered","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"they, and so just, that he will never damn the ignorant, and save onely","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,those that pretend to know him and his secret Counsels by their,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,Cabbala's; but he loves those that adore and worship him with fear and,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"reverence, and with a pure heart. she asked further, which of these two","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Cabbala's was most approved, the Natural, or Theological? The","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Theological, answered they, is mystical, and belongs onely to Faith; but","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"the Natural belongs to Reason. Then she asked them, Whether Divine Faith","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"was made out of Reason? No answered they, for Faith proceeds onely from","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"a Divine saving Grace, which is a peculiar Gift of God. How comes it","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"then, replied she, that Men, even those that are of several opinions,","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"have Faith more or less? A Natural Belief, answered they, is not a","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Divine Faith. But, proceeded the Empress, How are you sure that God","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"cannot be known? The several Opinions you Mortals have of God, answered","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"they, are sufficient witnesses thereof. Well then, replied the Empress,","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"leaving this inquisitive knowledg of God, I pray inform me, whether you","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Spirits give motion to Natural Bodies? No, answered they; but, on the","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"contrary, Natural material bodies give Spirits motion; for we Spirits,","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"being incorporeal, have no motion but from our Corporeal Vehicles, so","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"that we move by the help of our Bodies, and not the Bodies by our help;","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"for pure Spirits are immovable. If this be so, replied the Empress, How","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,comes it then that you can move so suddenly at a vast distance? They,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"answered, That some sorts of matter were more pure, rare, and","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,consequently more light and agil then others; and this was the reason,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"for their quick and sudden motions. Then the Empress asked them, Whether","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"they could speak without a body, or bodily organs? No, said they; nor","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"could we have any bodily sense, but onely knowledg. she asked, Whether","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"they could have Knowledg without Body? Not a Natural, answered they, but","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"a Supernatural Knowledg, which is a far better Knowledg then a Natural.","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Then she asked them, Whether they had a General or Universal Knowledg?","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"They answered, Single or particular created Spirits, have not; for not","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"any Creature, but God Himself, can have an absolute and perfect knowledg","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"of all things. The Empress asked them further, Whether Spirits had","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"inward and outward parts? No, answered they; for parts onely belong to","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"bodies, not to Spirits. Again, she asked them, Whether their Vehicles","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"were living Bodies? They are Self-moving Bodies, answered they, and","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"therefore they must needs be living; for nothing can move it self,","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"without it hath life. Then, said she, it must necessarily follow, that","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"this living, Self-moving Body gives motion to the Spirit, and not the","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Spirit motion to the Body, as its Vehicle. You say very true, answered","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"they, and we told you this before. Then the Empress asked them, Of what","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,forms of Matter those Vehicles were? They said they were of several,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"different forms; some gross and dense, and others more pure, rare, and","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"subtil. If you be not Material, said the Empress, how can you be","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Generators of all Creatures? We are no more, answered they, the","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Generators of material Creatures, then they are the Generators of us","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Spirits. Then she asked, Whether they did leave their Vehicles? No,","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"answered they; for we being incorporeal, cannot leave or quit them: but","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"our Vehicles do change into several forms and figures, according as","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"occasion requires. Then the Empress desired the Spirits to tell her,","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Whether Man was a little World? They answered, That if a Fly or Worm was","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"a little World, then Man was so too. she asked again, Whether our","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Fore-fathers had been as wise, as Men were at present, and had","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"understood sense and reason, as well as they did now? They answered,","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"That in former Ages they had been as wise as they are in this present,","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"nay, wiser; for, said they, many in this age do think their Fore-fathers","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"have been Fools, by which they prove themselves to be such. The Empress","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"asked further, Whether there was any Plastick power in Nature? Truly,","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"said the Spirits, Plastick power is a hard word, & signifies no more","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"then the power of the corporeal, figurative motions of Nature. After","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"this, the Empress desired the Spirits to inform her where the Paradise","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"was, Whether it was in the midst of the World as a Centre of pleasure?","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"or, Whether it was the whole World; or a peculiar World by it self, as a","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"World of Life, and not of Matter; or whether it was mixt, as a world of","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"living animal Creatures? They answered, That Paradise was not in the","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"world she came from, but in that world she lived in at present; and that","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"it was the very same place where she kept her Court, and where her","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Palace stood, in the midst of the Imperial City. The Empress asked","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"further, Whether in the beginning and Creation of the World, all Beasts","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"could speak? They answered, That no Beasts could speak, but onely those","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"sorts of Creatures which were Fish-men, Bear-men, Worm-men, and the","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"like, which could speak in the first Age, as well as they do now. she","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"asked again, Whether they were none of those Spirits that frighted Adam","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"out of the Paradise, at least caused him not to return thither again?","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"They an? swered they were not. Then she desired to be informed, whither","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Adam fled when he was driven out of the Paradise? Out of this World,","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"said they, you are now Empress of, into the World you came from. If this","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"be so, replied the Empress, then surely those Cabbalists are much out of","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"their story, who believe the Paradise to be a world of Life onely,","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"without Matter, for this world, though it be most pleasant and fruitful,","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"yet it is not a world of meer Immaterial life, but a world of living,","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Material Creatures. Without question, they are, answered the Spirits;","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"for not all Cabbala's are true. Then the Empress asked, That since it is","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"mentioned in the story of the Creation of the World, that Eve was","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"tempted by the Serpent, Whether the Devil was within the Serpent, or,","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Whether the Serpent tempted her without the Devil? They answered, That","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"the Devil was within the Serpent. But how came it then, replied she,","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"that the Serpent was cursed? They answered, because the Devil was in","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,him; for are not those men in danger of damnation which have the Devil,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"within them, who perswades them to believe and act wickedly? The Empress","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"asked further, Whether Light and the Heavens were all one? They","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"answered, That that Region which contains the Lucid natural Orbs, was by","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Mortals named Heaven; but the Beatifical Heaven, which is the Habitation","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"of the Blessed Angels and Souls, was so far beyond it, that it could not","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"be compared to any Natural Creature. Then the Empress asked them,","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Whether all Matter was fluid at first? They answered, That Matter was","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"always as it is, and that some parts of Matter were rare, some dense,","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"some fluid, some solid, &c. Neither was God bound to make all Matter","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"fluid at first. she asked further, Whether Matter was immovable in it","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"self? We have answered you before, said they, That there is no motion","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"but in Matter; and were it not for the motion of Matter, we Spirits,","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"could not move, nor give you any answer to your several questions. After","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"this, the Empress asked the Spirits, Whether the Universe was made","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"within the space of six days, or, Whether by those six days, were meant","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"so many Decrees or Commands of God? They answered her, That the World","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,was made by the All-powerful Decree and Command of God; but whether,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"there were six Decrees or Commands, or fewer, or more, no Creature was","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,able to tell.,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Then she inquired, Whether there was no mystery in Numbers? No other","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"mystery, answered the Spirits, but reckoning or counting; for Numbers","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,are onely marks of remembrance. But what do you think of the Number of,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Four, said she, which Cabbalists make such ado withal, and of the Number","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"of Ten, when they say that Ten is all, and that all Numbers are","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"virtually comprehended in Four? We think, answered they, that Cabbalists","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,have nothing else to do but to trouble their heads with such useless,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,Fancies; for naturally there is no such thing as prime or all in,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Numbers; nor is there any other mystery in Numbers, but what Man's fancy","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"makes; but what Men call Prime, or All, we do not know, because they do","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"not agree in the number of their opinion. Then the Empress asked,","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Whether the number of six was a symbole of Matrimony, as being made up","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"of Male and Femal, for two into three is six. If any number can be a","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"symbole of Matrimony, answered the Spirits, it is not Six, but Two; if","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,two may be allowed to be a Number: for the act of Matrimony is made up,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"of two joined in one. she asked again, What they said to the number of","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Seven? whether it was not an Embleme of God, because Cabbalists say,","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"That it is neither begotten, nor begets any other Number? There can be","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"no Embleme of God, answered the Spirits; for if we do not know what God","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"is, how can we make an Embleme of him? Nor is there any Number in God,","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,for God is the perfection Himself; but Numbers are imperfect; and as for,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"the begetting of numbers, it is done by Multiplication and Addition; but","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,Substraction is as a kind of death to Numbers. If there be no mystery in,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Numbers, replied the Empress then it is in vain to refer to the Creation","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"of the World to certain Numbers, as Cabbalists do. The onely mystery of","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Numbers, answered they, concerning the Creation of the World, is, that","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"as Numbers do multiply, so does the World. The Empress asked, how far","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Numbers did multiply? The Spirits answered, to Infinite. Why, said she,","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Infinite cannot be reckoned, nor numbred. No more, answered they, can","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"the parts of the Universe; for God's Creation, being an Infinite action,","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"as proceeding from an Infinite Power, could not rest upon a finite","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Number of Creatures, were it never so great. But leaving the mystery of","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Numbers, proceeded the Empress, Let me now desire you to inform me,","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Whether the Suns and Planets were generated by the Heavens, or ∆thereal","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Matter? The Spirits answered, That the Stars and Planets were of the","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"same matter which the Heavens, the ∆ther, and all other Natural","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,Creatures did consist of; but whether they were generated by the Heavens,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"or ∆ther, they could not tell: if they be, said they, they are not like","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"their Parents; for the Sun, Stars, and Planets, are more splendorous","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"then the ∆ther, as also more solid and constant in their motions: But","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"put the case, the Stars and Planets were generated by the Heavens, and","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"the ∆thereal Matter; the question then would be, Out of what these are","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"generated or produced? If these be created out of nothing, and not","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"generated out of something, then it is probable the Sun, Stars and","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Planets are so too; nay, it is more probable of the Stars, and Planets,","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"then of the Heavens, or the fluid ∆ther, by reason the Stars and Planets","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"seem to be further off from Mortality, then the particular parts of the","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"∆ther; for no doubt but the parts of the ∆thereal Matter, alter into","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"several forms, which we do not perceive of the Stars and Planets. The","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Empress asked further, Whether they could give her information of the","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"three principles of Man, according to the doctrine of the Platonists; as","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"first of the Intellect, Spirit, or Divine Light. 2. Of the Soul of Man","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"her self: and 3. Of the Image of the Soul, that is, her vital operation","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"on the body? The Spirits answered, That they did not understand these","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"three distinctions, but that they seem'd to corporeal sense and reason,","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"as if they were three several bodies, or three several corporeal","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"actions; however, said they, they are intricate conceptions of irregular","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Fancies. If you do not understand them, replied the Empress, how shall","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"human Creatures do then? Many, both of your modern and ancient","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Philosophers, answered the Spirits, endeavour to go beyond Sense and","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Reason, which makes them commit absurdities; for no corporeal Creature","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"can go beyond Sense and Reason; no not we Spirits, as long as we are in","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"our corporeal Vehicles. Then the Empress asked them, Whether there were","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"any Atheists in the World? The Spirits answered, That there were no more","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Atheists then what Cabbalists make. she asked them further, Whether","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Spirits were of a globous or round Figure? They answered, That Figure","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"belonged to body, but they being immaterial, had no Figure. she asked","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"again, Whether Spirits were not like Water or Fire? They answered, that","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Water and Fire was material, were it the purest and most refined that","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"ever could be; nay, were it above the Heavens: But we are no more like","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Water or Fire, said they, then we are like Earth; but our Vehicles are","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"of several forms, figures and degrees of substances. Then she desired to","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"know, Whether their Vehicles were made of Air? Yes, answered the","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Spirits, some of our Vehicles are of thin Air. Then I suppose, replied","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"the Empress, That those airy Vehicles, are your corporeal Summer-suits.","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"she asked further, Whether the Spirits had not ascending and","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"descending-motions, as well as other Creatures? They answered, That","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"properly there was no ascension or descension in Infinite Nature, but","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"onely in relation to particular parts; and as for us Spirits, said they,","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,We can neither ascend nor descend without corporeal Vehicles; nor can,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"our Vehicles ascend or descend, but according to their several shapes","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"and figures, for there can be no motion without body. The Empress asked","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"them further, Whether there was not a World of Spirits, as well as there","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"is of Material Creatures? No, answered they; for the word World implies","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"a quantity or multitude of corporeal Creatures, but we being Immaterial,","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,can make no World of Spirits. Then she desired to be informed when,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Spirits were made? We do not know, answered they, how and when we were","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"made, nor are we much inquisitive after it; nay, if we did, it would be","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"no benefit, neither for us, nor for you Mortals to know it. The Empress","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"replied, That Cabbalists and Divine Philosophers said, Mens rational","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Souls were Immaterial, and stood as much in need of corporeal Vehicles,","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"as Spirits did. If this be so, answered the Spirits, then you are","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Hermaphrodites of Nature; but your Cabbalists are mistaken, for they","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"take the purest and subtilest parts of Matter, for Immaterial Spirits.","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Then the Empress asked, When the Souls of Mortals went out of their","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Bodies, whether they went to Heaven or Hell; or whether, they remained","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"in airy Vehicles? God's Justice and Mercy, answered they, is perfect,","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"and not imperfect; but if you Mortals will have Vehicles for your Souls,","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"and a place that is between Heaven and Hell, it must be Purgatory, which","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"is a place of Purification, for which action Fire is more proper then","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Air; and so the Vehicles of those Souls that are in Purgatory, cannot be","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"airy, but fiery; and after this rate there can be but four places for","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"human Souls to be in, viz. Heaven, Hell, Purgatory, and this World; but","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"as for Vehicles, they are but fancies, not real truths. Then the Empress","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"asked them, Where Heaven and Hell was? Your Saviour Christ, answered the","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Spirits, has informed you, that there is Heaven and Hell, but he did not","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"tell you what, nor where they are; wherefore it is too great a","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,presumption for you Mortals to inquire after it: If you do but strive to,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"get into Heaven, it is enough, though you do not know where or what it","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"is; for it is beyond your knowledg and understanding. I am satisfied,","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"replied the Empress; and asked further, Whether there were any Figures","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"or Characters in the Soul? They answered, Where there was no Body, there","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"could be no Figure. Then she asked them, Whether Spirits could be naked?","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"and whether they were of a dark, or a light colour? As for our","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Nakedness, it is a very odd question, answered the Spirits; and we do","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,not know what you mean by a Naked Spirit; for you judg of us as of,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"corporeal Creatures; and as for Colour, said they, it is according to","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"our Vehicles; for Colour belongs to Body, and as there is no Body that","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"is colourless, so there is no Colour that is bodiless. Then the Empress","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"desired to be informed, Whether all Souls were made at the first","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Creation of the World? We know no more, answered the Spirits, of the","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"origin of humane Souls, then we know of our Selves. she asked further,","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,Whether humane bodies were not burthensome to humane Souls? They,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"answered, That Bodies, made Souls active, as giving them motion; and if","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"action was troublesome to Souls, then Bodies were so too. she asked","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"again, Whether Souls did chuse Bodies? They answered, That Platonicks","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"believed, the Souls of Lovers lived in the Bodies of their Beloved, but","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"surely, said they, if there be a multitude of Souls in a World of","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Matter, they cannot miss Bodies; for as soon as a Soul is parted from","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"one Body, it enters into another; and Souls having no motion of","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"themselves, must of necessity be clothed or imbodied with the next parts","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"of Matter. If this be so, replied the Empress, then I pray inform me,","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Whether all matter be soulified? The Spirits answered, They could not","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"exactly tell that; but if it was true, that Matter had no other motion","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"but what came from a spiritual power, and that all matter was moving,","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"then no soul could quit a Body, but she must, of necessity enter into","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"another soulified Body, and then there would be two immaterial","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"substances in one Body. The Empress asked, Whether it was not possible","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"that there could be two Souls in one Body? As for Immaterial Souls,","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"answered the Spirits, it is impossible; for there cannot be two","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Immaterials in one Inanimate Body, by reason they want parts, and place,","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,being bodiless; but there may be numerous material Souls in one composed,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Body, by reason every material part has a material natural Soul; for","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Nature is but one Infinite self-moving, living and self-knowing body,","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"consisting of the three degrees of inanimate, sensitive and rational","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Matter, so intermixt together, that no part of Nature, were it an Atom,","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"can be without any of these three Degrees; the sensitive is the Life,","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"the rational the Soul, and the inanimate part, the Body of Infinite","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Nature. The Empress was very well satisfied with this answer, and asked","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"further, Whether souls did not give life to bodies? No, answered they;","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"but Spirits and Divine Souls have a life of their own, which is not to","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"be divided, being purer then a natural life; for Spirits are","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"incorporeal, and consequently indivisible. But when the Soul is in its","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Vehicle, said the Empress, then methinks she is like the Sun, and the","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Vehicle like the Moon. No, answered they; but the Vehicle is like the","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Sun, and the Soul like the Moon; for the Soul hath motion from the Body,","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"as the Moon has light from the Sun. Then the Empress asked the Spirits,","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Whether it was an evil Spirit that tempted Eve, and brought all the","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"mischiefs upon Mankind: or, Whether it was the Serpent? They answered,","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"That Spirits could not commit actual evils. The Empress said, they might","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"do it by perswasions. They answered, That Perswasions were actions; But","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"the Empress not being contented with this answer, asked, Whether there","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"was not a supernatural Evil? The Spirits answered, That there was a","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Supernatural Good, which was God; but they knew of no Supernatural Evil,","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"that was equal to God. Then she desired to know, Whether Evil Spirits","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"were reckoned amongst the Beasts of the Field? They answer'd, That many","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Beasts of the field were harmless Creatures, and very serviceable for","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Man's use; and though some were accounted fierce and cruel, yet did they","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"exercise their cruelty upon other Creatures, for the most part, to no","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"other end, but to get themselves food, and to satisfie their natural","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"appetite; but certainly, said they, you Men are more cruel to one","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"another, then evil Spirits are to you; and as for their habitations in","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"desolate places, we having no communion with them, can give you no","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"certain account thereof. But what do you think, said the Empress, of","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,good Spirits? may not they be compared to the Fowls of the Air? They,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"answered, There were many cruel and ravenous Fowls as well in the Air,","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,as there were fierce and cruel Beasts on Earth; so that the good are,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"always mixt with the bad. she asked further, Whether the fiery Vehicles","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"were a Heaven, or a Hell, or at least a Purgatory to the Souls? They","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"answered, That if the Souls were immaterial, they could not burn, and","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,then fire would do them no harm; and though Hell was believed to be an,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"undecaying and unquenchable fire, yet Heaven was no fire. The Empress","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"replied, That Heaven was a Light. Yes, said they, but not a fiery Light.","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Then she asked, Whether the different shapes and sorts of Vehicles, made","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"the Souls and other Immaterial Spirits, miserable, or blessed? The","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Vehicles, answered they, make them neither better, nor worse; for though","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"some Vehicles sometimes may have power over others, yet these by turns","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"may get some power again over them, according to the several advantages","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,and disadvantages of particular Natural parts. The Empress asked,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"further, Whether Animal life came out of the spiritual World, and did","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"return thither again? The Spirits answered, They could not exactly tell;","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"but if it were so, then certainly Animal lives must leave their bodies","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"behind them, otherwise the bodies would make the spiritual World a mixt","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"World, that is, partly material, and partly immaterial; but the Truth","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"is, said they, Spirits being immaterial, cannot properly make a World;","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"for a World belongs to material, not to immaterial Creatures. If this be","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"so, replied the Empress, then certainly there can be no world of Lives","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"and Forms without Matter? No, answered the Spirits; nor a world of","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,Matter without Lives and Forms; for Natural Lives and Forms cannot be,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"immaterial, no more then Matter can be immovable. And therefore natural","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"lives, forms and matter, are inseparable. Then the Empress asked,","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,Whether the first Man did feed on the best sorts of the Fruits of the,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Earth, and the Beasts on the worst? The Spirits answered, That unless","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"the Beasts of the field were barred out of manured fields and gardens,","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,they would pick and chuse the best Fruits as well as Men; and you may,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"plainly observe it, said they, in Squirrels and Monkies, how they are","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,the best Chusers of Nuts and Apples; and how Birds do pick and feed in,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"the most delicious fruits, and Worms on the best roots, and most savoury","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"herbs; by which you may see, that those Creatures live and feed better","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"then men do, except you will say, that artificial Cookery is better and","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"more wholsome then the natural. Again, the Empress asked, Whether the","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"first Man gave Names to all the several sorts of Fishes in the Sea, and","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"fresh Waters? No, answered the Spirits, for he was an Earthly, and not a","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,Watery Creature; and therefore could not know the several sorts of,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Fishes. Why, replied the Empress, he was no more an Airy Creature then","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"he was a Watery one, and yet he gave Names to the several sorts of Fowls","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"and Birds of the Air. Fowls, answered they, are partly Airy, and partly","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Earthly Creatures, not onely because they resemble Beasts and Men in","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"their flesh, but because their rest and dwelling places are on Earth;","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"for they build their Nests, lay their Eggs, and hatch their Young, not","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"in the Air, but on the Earth. Then she asked, Whether the first Man did","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,give Names to all the various sorts of Creatures that live on the Earth?,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Yes, answered they, to all those that were presented to him, or he had","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"knowledg of, that is, to all the prime sorts; but not to every","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"particular: for of Mankind, said they, there were but two at first; and","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"as they did encrease, so did their Names. But, said the Empress, who","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"gave the Names to the several sorts of Fish? The posterity of Mankind,","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"answered they. Then she enquired, Whether there were no more kinds of","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Creatures now, then at the first Creation? They answered, That there","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,were no more nor fewer kinds of Creatures then there are now; but there,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"are, without question, more particular sorts of Creatures now, then","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"there were then. she asked again, Whether all those Creatures that were","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"in Paradise, were also in Noah's Ark? They answered, That the principal","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"kinds had been there, but not all the particulars. Then she would fain","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"know, how it came, that both Spirits and Men did fall from a blessed","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,into so miserable a state and condition as they are now in. The Spirits,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"answered, By disobedience. The Empress asked, Whence this disobedient","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,sin did proceed? But the Spirits desired the Empress not to ask them any,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"such questions, because they went beyond their knowledg. Then she begg'd","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"the Spirits to pardon her presumption; for, said she, It is the nature","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"of Mankind to be inquisitive. Natural desire of knowledg, answered the","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Spirits, is not blameable, so you do not go beyond what your Natural","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Reason can comprehend. Then I'le ask no more, said the Empress, for fear","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,I should commit some error; but one thing I cannot but acquaint you,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"withal: What is that, said the Spirits? I have a great desire, answered","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"the Empress, to make a Cabbala. What kind of Cabbala asked the Spirits?","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"The Empress answered, The Jews Cabbala. No sooner had the Empress","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"declared her Mind, but the Spirits immediately disappeared out of her","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"sight; which startled the Empress so much, that she fell into a Trance,","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"wherein she lay for some while; at last being come to her self again,","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"she grew very studious, and considering with her self what might be the","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"cause of this strange dysaster, conceived at first, that perhaps the","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,Spirits were tired with hearing and giving answers to her Questions; but,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"thinking by her self, That Spirits could not be tired, she imagined that","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"this was not the true cause of their disappearing, till, after divers","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"debates with her own thoughts, she did verily believe that the Spirits","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"had committed some fault in their answers, and that for their punishment","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,they were condemned to the lowest and darkest Vehicles. This belief was,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"so fixt in her mind, that it put her into a very Melancholick humor; and","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"then she sent both for her Fly-men and Worm-men, and declared to them","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"the cause of her sadness. 'Tis not so much, said she, the vanishing of","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"those Spirits that makes me Melancholick, but that I should be the cause","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"of their miserable condition, and that those harmless Spirits should,","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"for my sake, sink down into the black and dark abyss of the Earth. The","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Worm-men comforted the Empress, telling her, That the Earth was not so","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"horrid a Dwelling, as she did imagine; for, said they, not onely all","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Minerals and Vegetables, but several sorts of Animals can witness, that","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"the Earth is a warm, fruitful, quiet, safe, and happy habitation; and","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"though they want the light of the Sun, yet are they not in the dark, but","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"there is light even within the Earth, by which those Creatures do see","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,that dwell therein. This relation setled her Majesties mind a little;,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"but yet she being desirous to know the Truth, where, and in what","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"condition those Spirits were, commanded both the Fly- and Worm-men to","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,use all labour and industry to find them out; whereupon the Worm-men,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"straight descended into the Earth, and the Fly-men ascended into the","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Air. After some short time, the Worm-men returned, and told the Empress,","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"that when they went into the Earth, they inquired of all the Creatures","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"they met withal, Whether none of them had perceived such or such","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Spirits; until at last coming to the very Center of the Earth, they were","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"truly informed, that those Spirits had stayed some time there, but at","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,last were gone to the Antipodes on the other side of the Terrestrial,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Globe, diametrically opposite to theirs. The Fly-men seconded the","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Wormmen, assuring her Majesty, that their relation was very true; for,","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"said they, We have rounded the Earth, and just when we came to the","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Antipodes, we met those Spirits in a very good condition, and acquainted","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"them that your Majesty was very much troubled at their sudden departure,","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,and fear'd they should be buried in the darkness of the Earth: whereupon,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"the Spirits answered us, That they were sorry for having occasioned such","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,sadness and trouble in your Majesty; and desired us to tell your,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Majesty, that they feared no darkness; for their Vehicles were of such a","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"sort of substance as Cats eyes, Glow-worms tails, and rotten Wood,","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,carrying their light along with them; and that they were ready to do,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"your Majesty what service they could, in making your Cabbala. At which","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Relation the Empress was exceedingly glad, and rewarded both her Fly-","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,and Worm-men bountifully.,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"After some time, when the Spirits had refreshed themselves in their own","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Vehicles, they sent one of their nimblest Spirits, to ask the Empress,","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Whether she would have a Scribe, or, whether she would write the Cabbala","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"her self? The Empress received the proffer which they made her, with all","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"civility; and told them, that she desired a Spiritual Scribe. The","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Spirits answer'd, That they could dictate, but not write, except they","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"put on a hand or arm, or else the whole body of Man. The Empress","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"replied, How can Spirits arm themselves with gantlets of Flesh? As well,","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"answered they, as Man can arm himself with a gantlet of steel. If it be","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"so, said the Empress, then I will have a Scribe. Then the Spirits asked","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"her, Whether she would have the Soul of a living or a dead Man? Why,","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"said the Empress, can the Soul quit a living Body, and wander or travel","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"abroad? Yes, answered they, for according to Plato's Doctrine, there is","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"a Conversation of Souls, and the Souls of Lovers live in the Bodies of","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"their Beloved. Then I will have, answered she, the Soul of some ancient","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"famous Writer, either of Aristotle, Pythagoras, Plato, Epicurus, or the","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"like. The Spirits said, That those famous Men were very learned,","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"subtile, and ingenious Writers; but they were so wedded to their own","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"opinions, that they would never have the patience to be Scribes. Then,","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"said she, I'le have the Soul of one of the most famous modern Writers,","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"as either of Galileo, Gassendus, Des Cartes, Helmont, Hobbes, H. More,","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"&c. The Spirits answered, That they were fine ingenious Writers, but yet","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"so self-conceited, that they would scorn to be Scribes to a Woman. But,","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"said they, there's a Lady, the Duchess of Newcastle; which although she","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"is not one of the most learned, eloquent, witty and ingenious, yet she","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"is a plain and rational Writer; for the principle of her Writings, is","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Sense and Reason, and she will without question, be ready to do you all","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"the service she can. That Lady then, said the Empress, will I chuse for","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"my Scribe, neither will the Emperor have reason to be jealous, she being","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"one of my own sex. In truth, said the Spirit, Husbands have reason to be","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"jealous of Platonick Lovers, for they are very dangerous, as being not","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"onely intimate and close, but subtil and insinuating. You say well,","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,replied the Empress; wherefore I pray send me the Duchess of Newcastle's,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Soul; which the Spirit did; and after she came to wait on the Empress,","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,at her first arrival the Empress imbraced and saluted her with a,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Spiritual kiss; then she asked her whether she could write? Yes,","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"answered the Duchess's Soul, but not so intelligibly that any Reader","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"whatsoever may understand it, unless he be taught to know my Characters;","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"for my Letters are rather like Characters, then well formed Letters.","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Said the Empress, you were recommended to me by an honest and ingenious","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Spirit. Surely, answered the Duchess, the Spirit is ignorant of my","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"hand-writing. The truth is, said the Empress, he did not mention your","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"hand-writing; but he informed me, that you writ Sense and Reason, and if","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"you can but write so, that any of my Secretaries may learn your hand,","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"they shall write it out fair and intelligible. The Duchess answered,","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,That she questioned not but it might easily be learned in a short time.,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"But, said she to the Empress, What is it that your Majesty would have","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"written? she answered, The Jews Cabbala. Then your onely way for that","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"is, said the Duchess, to have the Soul of some famous Jew; nay, if your","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Majesty please, I scruple not, but you may as easily have the Soul of","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Moses, as of any other. That cannot be, replied the Empress, for no","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Mortal knows where Moses is. But, said the Duchess, humane Souls are","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"immortal; however, if this be too difficult to be obtained, you may have","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"the Soul of one of the chief Rabbies or Sages of the Tribe of Levi, who","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"will truly instruct you in that mystery; when as, otherwise, your","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Majesty will be apt to mistake, and a thousand to one, will commit gross","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"errors. No, said the Empress, for I shall be instructed by Spirits.","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Alas! said the Duchess, Spirits are as ignorant as Mortals in many","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"cases; for no created Spirits have a general or absolute knowledg, nor","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"can they know the Thoughts of Men, much less the Mysteries of the great","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Creator, unless he be pleased to inspire into them the gift of Divine","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Knowledg. Then, I pray, said the Empress, let me have your counsel in","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"this case. The Duchess answered, If your Majesty will be pleased to","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"hearken to my advice, I would desire you to let that work alone; for it","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"will be of no advantage either to you, or your people, unless you were","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"of the Jews Religion; nay, if you were, the vulgar interpretation of the","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"holy Scripture would be more instructive, and more easily believed, then","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,your mystical way of interpreting it; for had it been better and more,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"advantagious for the Salvation of the Jews, surely Moses would have","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"saved after Ages that labour by his own Explanation, he being not onely","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"a wise, but a very honest, zealous and religious Man: Wherefore the best","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"way, said she, is to believe with the generality the literal sense of","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"the Scripture, and not to make interpretations every one according to","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"his own fancy, but to leave that work for the Learned, or those that","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"have nothing else to do; Neither do I think, said she, that God will","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"damn those that are ignorant therein, or suffer them to be lost for want","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"of a Mystical interpretation of the Scripture. Then, said the Empress,","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"I'le leave the Scripture, and make a Philosophical Cabbala. The Duchess","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"told her, That, Sense and Reason would instruct her of a Nature as much","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"as could be known; and as for Numbers, they were infinite; but to add","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"non-sense to infinite, would breed a confusion, especially in Humane","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Understanding. Then, replied the Empress, I'le make a Moral Cabbala. The","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"onely thing, answered the Duchess, in Morality, is but, To fear God, and","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"to love his Neighbour, and this needs no further interpretation. But","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"then I'le make a Political Cabbala, said the Empress. The Duchess","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"answered, That the chief and onely ground in Government, was but Reward","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"and Punishment, and required no further Cabbala; But, said she, If your","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Majesty were resolved to make a Cabbala, I would advise you, rather to","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"make a Poetical or Romancical Cabbala, wherein you may use Metaphors,","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Allegories, Similitudes, &c. and interpret them as you please. With that","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"the Empress thank'd the Duchess, and embracing her Soul, told her she","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"would take her Counsel: she made her also her Favourite, and kept her","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"sometime in that World, and by this means the Duchess came to know and","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"give this Relation of all that passed in that rich, populous, and happy","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,World; and after some time the Empress gave her leave to return to her,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Husband and Kindred into her Native World, but upon condition, that her","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,Soul should visit her now and then; which she did: and truly their,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"meeting did produce such an intimate friendship between them, that they","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"became Platonick Lovers, although they were both Femals.","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"One time, when the Duchess her Soul was with the Empress, she seem'd to","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"be very sad and melancholy; at which the Empress was very much troubled,","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"and asked her the reason of her Melancholick humour? Truly, said the","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Duchess to the Empress, (for between dear friends there's no","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"

,"Melancholy proceeds from an extream Ambition. The Empress asked, What","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"the height of her ambition was? The Duchess answered, That neither she","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"her self, nor no Creature in the World was able to know either the","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"height, depth, or breadth of her Ambition; but said she, my present","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"desire is, that I would be a great Princess. The Empress replied, so you","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"are; for you are a Princess of the fourth or fifth Degree, for a Duke or","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Duchess is the highest title or honour that a subject can arrive to, as","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,being the next to a King's Title; and as for the name of a Prince of,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Princess, it belongs to all that are adopted to the Crown; so that those","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"that can add a Crown to their Arms, are Princes, and therefore a Duke is","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"a Title above a Prince; for example, the Duke of Savoy, the Duke of","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Florence, the Duke of Lorrain, as also Kings Brothers, are not called by","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"the name of Princes, but Dukes, this being the higher Title. 'Tis true,","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"answered the Duchess, unless it be Kings Eldest sons, and they are","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"created Princes. Yes, replied the Empress, but no soveraign does make a","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"subject equal to himself, such as Kings eldest sons partly are: And","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"although some Dukes be soveraigns, yet I have heard that a Prince by his","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Title is soveraign, by reason the Title of a Prince is more a Title of","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Honour, then of soveraignty; for, as I said before, it belongs to all","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"that are adopted to the Crown. Well, said the Duchess, setting aside","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"this dispute, my Ambition is, That I would fain be as you are, that is,","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"an Empress of a World, and I shall never be at quiet until I be one. I","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"love you so well, replied the Empress, that I wish with all my soul, you","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"had the fruition of your ambitious desire, and I shall not fail to give","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,you my best advice how to accomplish it; the best informers are the,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Immaterial Spirits, and they'l soon tell you, Whether it be possible to","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"obtain your wish. But, said the Duchess, I have little acquaintance with","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"them, for I never knew any before the time you sent for me. They know","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"you, replied the Empress; for they told me of you, and were the means","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"and instrument of your coming hither: Wherefore I'le conferr with them,","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"and enquire whether there be not another World, whereof you may be","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Empress as well as I am of this? No sooner had the Empress said this,","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"but some Immaterial Spirits came to visit her, of whom she inquired,","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Whether there were but three Worlds in all, to wit, the Blazing World","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"where she was in, the World which she came from, and the World where the","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Duchess lived? The Spirits answered, That there were more numerous","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,Worlds then the Stars which appeared in these three mentioned Worlds.,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Then the Empress asked, Whether it was not possible that her dearest","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"friend the Duchess of Newcastle, might be Empress of one of them?","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Although there be numerous, nay, infinite Worlds, answered the Spirits,","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"yet none is without Government. But is none of these Worlds so weak,","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"said she, that it may be surprized or conquered? The Spirits answered,","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"That Lucian's World of Lights, had been for some time in a snuff, but of","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"

,"so strengthened the Immortal parts thereof with mortal out-works, as it","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"was for the present impregnable. said the Empress, If there be such an","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Infinite number of Worlds, I am sure, not onely my friend, the Duchess,","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"but any other might obtain one. Yes, answered the Spirits, if those","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,Worlds were uninhabited; but they are as populous as this your Majesty,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"governs. Why, said the Empress, it is not possible to conquer a World.","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"No, answered the Spirits, but, for the most part, Conquerers seldom","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"enjoy their conquest, for they being more feared then loved, most","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"commonly come to an untimely end. If you will but direct me, said the","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Duchess to the Spirits, which World is easiest to be conquered, her","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Majesty will assist me with Means, and I will trust to Fate and Fortune;","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"for I had rather die in the adventure of noble atchievements, then live","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"in obscure and sluggish security; since the by one, I may live in a","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,glorious Fame; and by the other I am buried in oblivion. The Spirits,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"answered, That the lives of Fame were like other lives; for some lasted","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"long, and some died soon. 'Tis true, said the Duchess; but yet the","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"shortest-liv'd Fame lasts longer then the longest life of Man. But,","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"replied the Spirits, if occasion does not serve you, you must content","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,your self to live without such atchievements that may gain you a Fame:,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"But we wonder, proceeded the Spirits, that you desire to be Empress of a","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Terrestrial World, when as you can create your self a Cúlestial World if","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"you please. What, said the Empress, can any Mortal be a Creator? Yes,","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,answered the Spirits; for every human Creature can create an Immaterial,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"World fully inhabited by Immaterial Creatures, and populous of","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"

,"make Whirl-pools, Lights, Pressures, and Reactions, &c. as he thinks","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"best; nay, he may make a World full of Veins, Muscles, and Nerves, and","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,all these to move by one jolt or stroke: also he may alter that World as,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"often as he pleases, or change it from a Natural World, to an","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Artificial; he may make a World of Ideas, a World of Atoms, a World of","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Lights, or whatsoever his Fancy leads him to. And since it is in your","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"power to create such a World, What need you to venture life, reputation","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"and tranquility, to conquer a gross material World? For you can enjoy no","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"more of a material world then a particular Creature is able to enjoy,","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"which is but a small part, considering the compass of such a world; and","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"you may plainly observe it by your friend the Empress here, which","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"although she possesses a whole World, yet enjoys she but a part thereof;","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"neither is she so much acquainted with it, that she know all the places,","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Countries, and Dominions she Governs. The truth is, a soveraign Monarch","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,has the general trouble; but the Subjects enjoy all the delights and,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"pleasures in parts, for it is impossible, that a Kingdom, nay, a","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Country, should be injoyed by one person at once, except he take the","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"pains to travel into every part, and endure the inconveniencies of going","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"from one place to another? wherefore, since glory, delight, and pleasure","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"lives but in other mens opinions, and can neither add tranquility to","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"

,"Empress of a Material World, and be troubled with the cares that attend","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Government? when as by creating a World within your self, you may enjoy","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"all both in whole and in parts, without controle or opposition; and may","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"make what World you please, and alter it when you please, and enjoy as","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,much pleasure and delight as a World can afford you? You have converted,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"me, said the Duchess to the Spirits, from my ambitious desire;","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"wherefore, I'le take your advice, reject and despise all the Worlds","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"without me, and create a World of my own. The Empress said, If I do make","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"such a world, then I shall be Mistress of two Worlds, one within, and","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"the other without me. That your Majesty may, said the Spirits; and so","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,left these two Ladies to create two Worlds within themselves: who did,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"also part from each other, until such time as they had brought their","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,Worlds to perfection. The Duchess of Newcastle was most earnest and,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"industrious to make her World, because she had none at present; and","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"first she resolved to frame it according to the opinion of Thales, but","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"she found her self so much troubled with DÊmons, that they would not","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"suffer her to take her own will, but forced her to obey their orders and","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"commands; which she being unwilling to do, left off from making a world","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"that way, and began to frame one according to Pythagoras's Doctrine; but","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"in the Creation thereof, she was so puzled with numbers, how to order","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"and compose the several parts, that she having no skill in Arithmetick,","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,was forced also to desist from the making of that World. Then she,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,intended to create a World according to the opinion of Plato; but she,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"found more trouble and difficulty in that, then in the two former; for","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,the numerous Idea's having no other motion but what was derived from her,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"mind, whence they did flow and issue out, made it a far harder business","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"to her, to impart motion to them, then Puppit-players have in giving","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"motion to every several Puppit; in so much, that her patience was not","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,able to endure the trouble which those Ideas caused her; wherefore she,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"annihilated also that World, and was resolved to make one according to","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"the Opinion of Epicurus; which she had no sooner begun, but the infinite","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Atoms made such a mist, that it quite blinded the perception of her","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,mind; neither was she able to make a Vacuum as a receptacle for those,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Atoms, or a place which they might retire into; so that partly for the","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"want of it, and of a good order and method, the confusion of those Atoms","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"produced such strange and monstrous figures, as did more affright then","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"delight her, and caused such a Chaos in her mind, as had almost","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"dissolved it. At last, having with much ado cleansed and cleared her","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"mind of these dusty and misty particles, she endeavored to create a","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"World according to Aristotle's Opinion; but remembring that her mind, as","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"most of the Learned hold it, was Immaterial, and that, according to","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Aristotle's Principle, out of Nothing, Nothing could be made; she was","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"forced also to desist from that work, and then she fully resolved, not","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"to take any more patterns from the Ancient Philosophers, but to follow","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"the Opinions of the Moderns; and to that end, she endeavoured to make a","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,World according to Des Cartes Opinion; but when she had made the,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"∆thereal Globules, and set them a moving by a strong and lively","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"imagination, her mind became so dizzie with their extraordinary swift","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"turning round, that it almost put her into a swoon; for her thoughts,","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"but their constant tottering, did so stagger, as if they had all been","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"drunk: wherefore she dissolved that World, and began to make another,","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,according to Hobbs's Opinion; but when all the parts of this Imaginary,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"

,"Wolves that worry sheep, or like so many Dogs that hunt after Hares; and","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"when she found a re-action equal to those pressures, her mind was so","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"squeezed together, that her thoughts could neither move forward nor","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"

,"most Divine, shall know whether it be your own soul, or not: which the","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Empress was very glad at, and after the Spirits were gone, asked the","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Duchess, how her body was supplied in the absence of her soul? who","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"answered Her Majesty, That her body, in the absence of her soul, was","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,governed by her sensitive and rational corporeal motions. Thus those two,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,Female Souls travelled together as lightly as two thoughts into the,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Duchess her native World; and, which is remarkable, in a moment viewed","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"all the parts of it, and all the actions of all the Creatures therein,","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,especially did the Empress's Soul take much notice of the several,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,actions of humane Creatures in all the several Nations and parts of that,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"World, and wonder'd that for all there were so many several Nations,","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Governments, Laws, Religions, Opinions, &c. they should all yet so","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"generally agree in being Ambitious, Proud, Self-conceited, Vain,","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Prodigal, Deceitful, Envious, Malicious, Unjust, Revengeful,","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Irreligious, Factious, &c. she did also admire, that not any particular","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"State, Kingdom or Common-wealth, was contented with their own shares,","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"but endeavoured to encroach upon their Neighbours, and that their","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"greatest glory was in Plunder and Slaughter, and yet their victory's","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"less then their expences, and their losses more than their gains; but","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"their being overcome, in a manner their utter ruine: But that she","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"wonder'd most at, was, that they should prize or value dirt more then","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"mens lives, and vanity more then tranquility: for the Emperor of a","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"world, said she, injoys but a part, not the whole; so that his pleasure","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"consists in the Opinions of others. It is strange to me, answered the","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Duchess, that you should say thus, being your self, an Empress of a","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"World; and not onely of a world, but of a peaceable, quiet, and obedient","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"world. 'Tis true, replied the Empress: but although it is a peaceable","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"and obedient world, yet the Government thereof is rather a trouble, then","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"a pleasure; for order cannot be without industry, contrivance, and","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"direction: besides, the Magnificent state, that great Princes keep or","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"ought to keep, is troublesome. Then by your Majestie's discourse, said","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"the Duchess, I perceive that the greatest happiness in all the Worlds","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"consist in Moderation: No doubt of it, replied the Empress; and after","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"these two souls had visited all the several places, Congregations and","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Assemblies both in Religion and State, the several Courts of Judicature","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"and the like, in several Nations, the Empress said, That of all the","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Monarchs of the several parts of the World, she had observed the","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Grand-Seignior was the greatest; for his word was a Law, and his power","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,absolute. But the Duchess pray'd the Empress to pardon her that she was,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"of another mind; for, said she, he cannot alter Mahomets Laws and","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Religion; so that the Law and Church do govern the Emperor, and not the","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Emperor them. But, replied the Empress, he has power in some","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"particulars; as for example, To place and displace Subjects in their","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"particular Governments of Church and State; and having that, he has the","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Command both over Church and State, and none dares oppose him. 'Tis","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"true, said the Duchess; but if it pleases your Majesty, we will go into","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"that part of the World whence I came to wait on your Majesty, and there","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,you shall see as powerful a Monarch as the Grand Signior; for though his,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Dominions are not of so large extent, yet they are much stronger, his","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Laws are easie and safe, and he governs so justly and wisely, that his","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,Subjects are the happiest people of all the Nations or parts of that,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"World. This Monarch, said the Empress, I have a great mind to see. Then","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"they both went, and in a short time arrived into his Dominions; but","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"coming into the Metropolitan City, the Empress's Soul observed many","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Gallants go into an House; and enquiring of the Duchess's Soul, what","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"House that was? she told her, It was one of the Theatres where Comedies","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"and Tragedies were acted. The Empress asked, Whether they were real? No,","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"said the Duchess, they are feigned. Then the Empress desired to enter","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"into the Theatre; and when she had seen the Play that was asked, the","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Duchess asked her how she liked that Recreation? I like it very well,","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,said the Empress; but I observe that the Actors make a better show than,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,the Spectators; and the Scenes a better than the Actors and the Musick,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,and Dancing is more pleasant and acceptable than the Play it self; for I,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"see, the Scenes stand for Wit, the Dancing for Humour, and the Musick is","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"the Chorus. I am sorry, replied the Duchess, to hear your Majesty say","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"so; for if the Wits of this part of the World should hear you, they","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"would condemn you. What, said the Empress, would they condemn me for","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,preferring a natural Face before a Sign-post; or a natural Humour before,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,an artificial Dance; or Musick before a true and profitable Relation? As,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"for Relation, replied the Duchess, our Poets defie and condemn it into a","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Chimney-corner, fitter for old Womens Tales, than Theatres. Why, said","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,the Empress do not your Poets Actions comply with their Judgments? For,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"their Plays are composed of old Stories, either of Greek or Roman, or","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"some new-found World. The Duchess answered Her Majesty, That it was","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"true, that all or most of their Plays were taken out of old Stories; but","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"yet they had new Actions, which being joined to old Stories, together","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"with the addition of new Prologues, Scenes, Musick and Dancing, made new","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,Plays.,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"After this, both the Souls went to the Court, where all the Royal Family","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"was together, attended by the chief of the Nobles of their Dominions,","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,which made a very magnificent Show; and when the Soul of the Empress,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"viewed the King and Queen, she seemed to be in a maze, which the","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Duchess's Soul perceiving, asked the Empress how she liked the King, the","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Queen, and all the Royal Race? she answered, that in all the Monarchs","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"she had seen in that World, she had not found so much Majesty and","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Affability mixt so exactly together, that none did overshadow or eclipse","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"the other; and as for the Queen, she said that Vertue sat Triumphant in","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"her face, and Piety was dwelling in her heart; and that all the Royal","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,Family seem'd to be endued with a Divine splendor: but when she had,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"heard the King discourse, she believ'd that Mercury and Apollo had been","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"his Cúlestial Instructors; and, my dear Lord and Husband, added the","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Duchess, has been his Earthly Governor. But after some short stay in the","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Court, the Duchess's soul grew very Melancholy; the Empress asking the","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"cause of her sadness? she told her, That she had an extreme desire to","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"converse with the soul of her Noble Lord and dear Husband, and that she","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,was inpatient of a longer stay. The Empress desired the Duchess to have,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"but patience so long, until the King, the Queen, and the Royal Family","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"were retired, and then she would bear her Company to her Lord and","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Husband's Soul, who at that time lived in the Country some 112 miles","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,off; which she did: and thus these two souls went towards those parts of,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,the Kingdom where the Duke of Newcastle was.,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"But one thing I forgot all this while, which is, That although thoughts","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,are the natural language of Souls; yet by reason Souls cannot travel,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"without Vehicles, they use such language as the nature and propriety of","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"their Vehicles require, and the Vehicles of those two souls being made","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"of the purest and finest sort of air, and of a human shape: This purity","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,and fineness was the cause that they could neither be seen nor heard by,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"any human Creature; when as, had they been of some grosser sort of Air,","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,the sound of the Air's language would have been as perceptible as the,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,blowing of Zephyrus.,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,And now to return to my former Story; when the Empress's and Duchess's,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Soul were travelling into Nottinghamshire, (for that was the place where","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"the Duke did reside) passing through the Forrest of sherewood, the","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Empress's Soul was very much delighted with it, as being a dry, plain","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"and woody place, very pleasant to travel in, both in Winter and Summer;","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,for it is neither much dirty nor dusty at no time: At last they arrived,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"at Welbeck, a House where the Duke dwell'd, surrounded all with Wood, so","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"close and full, that the Empress took great pleasure and delight","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"therein, and told the Duchess she never had observed more Wood in so","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,little compass in any part of the Kingdom she had passed through. The,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"truth is, said she, there seems to be more Wood on the Seas (she meaning","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"the Ships) than on the Land. The Duchess told her, The reason was, that","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"there had been a long Civil Warr in that Kingdom, in which most of the","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,best Timber-trees and Principal Palaces were ruined and destroyed; and,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"my dear Lord and Husband, said she, has lost by it half his Woods,","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"besides many Houses, Land, and movable Goods; so that all the loss out","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"of his particular Estate, did amount to above Half a Million of Pounds.","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"I wish, said the Empress, he had some of the Gold that is in the","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Blazing-World, to repair his losses. The Duchess most humbly thank'd her","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Imperial Majesty for her kind wishes; but, said she, Wishes will not","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"repair his ruins: however, God has given my Noble Lord and Husband great","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Patience, by which he bears all his losses and misfortunes. As last they","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"enter'd into the Duke's House, an Habitation not so magnificent as","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"useful; and when the Empress saw it, Has the Duke, said she, no other","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"House but this? Yes, answered the Duchess, some five miles from this","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"place he has a very fine Castle called Bolesover. That place, then, said","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"the Empress, I desire to see. Alas, replied the Duchess, it is but a","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"naked House, and uncloath'd of all Furniture. However, said the Empress,","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"I may see the manner of its structure and building. That you may,","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"replied the Duchess, and as they were thus discoursing, the Duke came","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"out of the House into the Court, to see his Horses of Manage; whom when","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"the Duchess's Soul perceived, she was so overjoyed, that her Aereal","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Vehicle became so splendorous, as if it had been enlightned by the Sun;","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"by which we may perceive, that the passions of Souls or Spirits can","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,alter their bodily Vehicles. Then these two Ladies Spirits went close to,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"him, but he could not perceive them; and after the Empress had observed","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"that Art of Mannage, she was much pleased with it, and commended it as a","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"noble pastime, and an exercise fit and proper for noble and heroick","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Persons. But when the Duke was gone into the house again, those two","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Souls followed him; where the Empress observing, that he went to the","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"exercise of the sword, and was such an excellent and unparallel'd Master","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"thereof, she was as much pleased with that exercise, as she was with the","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"former: But the Duchess's Soul being troubled, that her dear Lord and","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Husband used such a violent exercise before meat, for fear of","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"overheating himself, without any consideration of the Empress's Soul,","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"left her ∆real Vehicle, and entred into her Lord. The Empress's Soul","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"perceiving this, did the like: And then the Duke had three Souls in one","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Body; and had there been some such Souls more, the Duke would have been","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"like the Grand-Signior in his Seraglio, onely it would have been a","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Platonick Seraglio. But the Duke's Soul being wise, honest, witty,","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"complaisant and noble, afforded such delight and pleasure to the","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Empress's Soul by his conversation, that these two souls became","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"enamoured of each other; which the Duchess's soul perceiving, grew","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"jealous at first, but then considering that no Adultery could be","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"committed amongst Platonick Lovers, and that Platonism, was Divine, as","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"being derived from Divine Plato, cast forth of her mind that Idea of","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Jealousie. Then the Conversation of these three souls was so pleasant,","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,that it cannot be expressed; for the Duke's Soul entertained the,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Empress's Soul with Scenes, songs, Musick, witty Discourses, pleasant","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Recreations, and all kinds of harmless sports, so that the time passed","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,away faster than they expected. At last a Spirit came and told the,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Empress, That although neither the Emperor nor any of his Subjects knew","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,that her Soul was absent; yet the Emperor's Soul was so sad and,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"melancholy for want of His own beloved Soul, that all the Imperial Court","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,took notice of it. Wherefore he advised the Empress's Soul to return,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"into the Blazing-World, into her own Body she left there; which both the","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Duke's and Duchess's Soul was very sorry for, and wished that, if it had","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"been possible, the Empress's Soul might have stayed a longer time with","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"them; but seeing it could not be otherwise, they pacified themselves.","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"But before the Empress returned into the Blazing-World, the Duchess","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"desired a Favour of her, to wit, That she would be pleased to make an","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Agreement between her Noble Lord, and Fortune. Why, said the Empress,","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"are they Enemies? Yes, answered the Duchess, and they have been so ever","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"since I have been his Wife: nay, I have heard my Lord say, That she hath","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"crossed him in all things, ever since he could remember. I am sorry for","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"that, replied the Empress; but I cannot discourse with Fortune, without","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"the help of an Immaterial Spirit, and that cannot be done in this World;","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"for I have no Fly nor Bird-men here, to send into the Region of the Air,","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"where, for the most part, their Habitations are. The Duchess said, she","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,would entreat her Lord to send an Attorney or Lawyer to plead his Cause.,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Fortune will bribe them, replied the Empress, and so the Duke may chance","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"to be cast: Wherefore the best way will be, for the Duke to chuse a","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Friend on his side, and let Fortune chuse another, and try whether by","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"this means it be possible to compose the Difference. The Duchess said,","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"They will never come to an agreement, unless there be a Judg or Umpire","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"to decide the Case. A Judg, replied the Empress, is easie to be had; but","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"to get an Impartial Judg, is a thing so difficult, that I doubt we shall","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"hardly find one; for there is none to be had, neither in Nature, nor in","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Hell, but onely from Heaven; and how to get such a Divine and Celestial","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Judg, I cannot tell: Nevertheless, if you will go along with me into the","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Blazing-World, I'le try what may be done. 'Tis my duty, said the","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Duchess, to wait on your Majesty, and I shall most willingly do it, for","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,I have no other interest to consider. Then the Duchess spake to the Duke,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"concerning the difference between him and Fortune, and how it was her","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"desire that they might be friends. The Duke answered, That for his part","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"he had always with great industry sought her friendship, but as yet he","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"could never obtain it, for she had always been his Enemy. However, said","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"he, I'le try and send my two Friends, Prudence and Honesty, to plead my","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,Cause. Then these two Friends went with the Duchess and the Empress into,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"the Blazing-World; (for it is to be observed, that they are somewhat","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"like Spirits, because they are Immaterial, although their actions are","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"corporeal:) and after their arrival there, when the Empress had","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"refreshed her self, and rejoiced with the Emperor, she sent her Fly-men","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"for some of the Spirits, and desired their assistance, to compose the","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"difference between Fortune, and the Duke of Newcastle. But they told her","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Majesty, That Fortune was so inconstant, that although she would perhaps","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"promise to hear their Cause pleaded, yet it was a thousand to one,","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"whether she would ever have the patience to do it: Nevertheless, upon","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Her Majestie's request, they tried their utmost, and at last prevailed","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"with Fortune so far, that she chose Folly and Rashness, for her Friends,","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"but they could not agree in chusing a Judg; until at last, with much","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"ado, they concluded, that Truth should hear, and decide the cause. Thus","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"all being prepared, and the time appointed, both the Empress and","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,Duchess's Soul went to hear them plead; and when all the Immaterial,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Company was met, Fortune standing upon a Golden-Globe, made this","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,following Speech:,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Noble Friends, We are met here to hear a Cause pleaded concerning the","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"difference between the Duke of Newcastle, and my self; and though I am","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"willing upon the perswasions of the Ambassadors of the Empress, the","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Immaterial Spirits, to yield to it, yet it had been fit, the Duke's Soul","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"should be present also, to speak for her self; but since she is not","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"here, I shall declare my self to his Wife, and his Friends, as also to","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"my Friends, especially the Empress, to whom I shall chiefly direct my","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Speech. First, I desire your Imperial Majesty may know, that this Duke","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"who complains or exclaims so much against me, hath been always my enemy;","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"for he has preferred Honesty and Prudence before me, and slighted all my","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"favours; nay, not onely thus, but he did fight against me, and preferred","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"his Innocence before my Power. His Friends Honesty and Prudence, said he","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"most scornfully, are more to be regarded, than Inconstant Fortune, who","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"is onely a friend to Fools and Knaves; for which neglect and scorn,","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"whether I have not just reason to be his enemy, your Majesty may judg","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,your self.,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"After Fortune had thus ended her Speech, the Duchess's Soul rose from","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"her seat, and spake to the Immaterial Assembly in this manner:","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Noble Friends, I think it fit, by your leave, to answer Lady Fortune in","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"the behalf of my Noble Lord and Husband, since he is not here himself;","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,and since you have heard her complaint concerning the choice my Lord,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"made of his Friends, and the neglect and disrespect he seemed to cast","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"upon her; give me leave to answer, that, first concerning the Choice of","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"his Friends, He has proved himself a wise man in it; and as for the","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"disrespect and rudeness her Ladiship accuses him of, I dare say he is so","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"much a Gentleman, that I am confident he would never slight, scorn or","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,disrespect any of the Female Sex in all his life time; but was such a,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"servant and Champion for them, that he ventured Life and Estate in their","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"service; but being of an honest, as well as an honourable Nature, he","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"could not trust Fortune with that which he preferred above his life,","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"which was his Reputation, by reason Fortune did not side with those that","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"were honest and honourable, but renounced them; and since he could not","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"be of both sides, he chose to be of that which was agreeable both to his","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Conscience, Nature and Education; for which choice Fortune did not onely","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"declare her self his open Enemy, but fought with him in several Battels;","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"nay, many times, hand to hand; at last, she being a Powerful Princess,","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"and as some believe, a Deity, overcame him, and cast him into a","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Banishment, where she kept him in great misery, ruined his Estate, and","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"took away from him most of his Friends; nay, even when she favoured many","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"that were against her, she still frowned on him; all which he endured","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"with the greatest patience, and with that respect to Lady Fortune, that","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"he did never in the least endeavour to disoblige any of her Favourites,","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"but was onely sorry that he, an honest man, could find no favor in her","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Court; and since he did never injure any of those she favoured, he","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"neither was an enemy to her Ladiship, but gave her always that respect","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"and worship which belonged to her power and dignity, and is still ready","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"at any time honestly and prudently to serve her; he onely begs, her","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Ladiship would be his friend for the future, as she hath been his enemy","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,in times past.,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"As soon as the Duchess's Speech was ended, Folly and Rashness started","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"up, and both spake so thick and fast at once, that not onely the","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Assembly, but themselves were not able to understand each other: At","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,which Fortune was somewhat out of countenance; and commanded them either,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"to speak singly, or be silent: But Prudence told her Ladiship, she","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"should command them to speak wisely, as well as singly; otherwise, said","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"she, it were best for them not to speak at all: Which Fortune resented","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"very ill, and told Prudence, she was too bold; and then commanded Folly","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,to declare what she would have made known: but her Speech was so,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"foolish, mixt with such Non-sense, that none knew what to make of it;","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"besides, it was so tedious, that Fortune bid her to be silent; and","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"commanded Rashness to speak for her, who began after this manner:","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Great Fortune; The Duchess of Newcastle has proved her self, according","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"to report, a very Proud and Ambitious Lady, in presuming to answer you","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"her own self, in this noble Assembly without your Command, in a Speech","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"wherein she did not onely contradict you, but preferred Honesty and","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Prudence before you; saying, That her Lord was ready to serve you","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,honestly and prudently; which presumption is beyond all pardon; and if,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"you allow Honesty and Prudence to be above you, none will admire,","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"worship, or serve you; but you'l be forced to serve your self, and will","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"be despised, neglected and scorned by all; and from a Deity, become a","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"

,,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Beautiful Truth, Great Fortune, and you the rest of my noble Friends; I","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,am come a great and long journey in the behalf of my dear Friend the,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Duke of Newcastle; not to make more wounds, but, if it be possible, to","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,heal those that are made already. Neither do I presume to be a Deity;,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"

,"Offering, I being an humble and devout supplicant; and since no offering","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"

,,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Thus she spake, and as she was going up, up started Honesty (for she has","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,not always so much discretion as she ought to have) and interrupted,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,Prudence.,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"I came not here, said she, to hear Fortune flattered, but to hear the","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,Cause decided between Fortune and the Duke; neither came I hither to,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"speak Rhetorically and Eloquently, but to propound the case plainly and","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"truly; and I'le have you know, that the Duke, whose Cause we argue, was","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"and is my Foster-son; for I Honesty bred him from his Childhood, and","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"made a perpetual friendship betwixt him and Gratitude, Charity and","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Generosity; and put him to School to Prudence, who taught him Wisdom,","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"and informed him in the Rules of Temperance, Patience, Justice, and the","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"like; then I put him into the University of Honour, where he learned all","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Honourable Qualities, Arts, and Sciences; afterward I sent him to travel","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"through the World of Actions, and made Observation his Governor; and in","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"those his travels, he contracted a friendship with Experience; all","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"which, made him fit for Heavens Blessings, and Fortunes Favours: But she","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"hating all those that have merit and desert, became his inveterate","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Enemy, doing him all the mischief she could, until the God of Justice","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"opposed Fortune's Malice, and pull'd him out of those ruines she had","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,cast upon him: For this God's Favourites were the Dukes Champions;,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"wherefore to be an Enemy to him, were to be an Enemy to the God of","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Justice: In short, the true cause of Fortunes Malice to this Duke is,","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"that he would never flatter her; for I Honesty, did command him not to","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"do it, or else he would be forced to follow all her inconstant ways, and","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"obey all her unjust commands, which would cause a great reproach to him:","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"but, on the other side, Prudence advised him not to despise Fortune's","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"favours, for that would be an obstrustion and hinderance to his worth","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"and merit; and He to obey both our advice and counsels, did neither","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,flatter nor despise Her; but was always humble and respectful to her so,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"far as Honour, Honesty and Conscience would permit: all which I refer to","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Truth's Judgment, and expect her final Sentence.","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Fortune hearing thus Honesty's plain Speech, thought it very rude, and","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"would not hearken to Truth's Judgment, but went away in a Passion: At","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"which, both the Empress and Duchess were extreamly troubled, that their","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"endeavours should have no better effect: but Honesty chid the Duchess,","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"and said, she was to be punished for desiring so much Fortune's favours;","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"for it appears, said she, that you mistrust the gods blessings: At which","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"the Duchess wept, answering Honesty, That she did neither mistrust the","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"gods blessings, nor relye upon Fortune's favours; but desired onely that","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,her Lord might have no potent Enemies. The Empress being much troubled,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"to see her weep, told Honesty in anger, she wanted the discretion of","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Prudence; for though you are commended, said she, yet you are apt to","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"commit many indiscreet actions, unless Prudence be your guide. At which","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"reproof Prudence smiled, and Honesty was somewhat out of countenance;","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,but they soon became very good friends: and after the Duchess's Soul had,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"stayed some time with the Empress in the Blazing-World, she begg'd leave","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"of her to return to her Lord and Husband; which the Empress granted her,","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,upon condition she should come and visit her as often as conveniently,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"she could, promising that she would do the same to the Duchess.","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Thus the Duchess's soul, after she had taken her leave of the Empress,","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"as also of the Spirits, who with great civility, promised her, that they","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,would endeavour in time to make a Peace and Agreement between Fortune,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"and the Duke, returned with Prudence and Honesty, into her own World:","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"But when she was just upon her departure, the Empress sent to Her, and","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,desired that she might yet have some little conference with her before,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,she went; which the Duchess most willingly granted her Majesty; and when,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"she came to wait on her, the Empress told the Duchess, That she being","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"her dear Platonick Friend, of whose just and Impartial Judgment, she had","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"alwayes a very great esteem; could not forbear, before she went from","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"her, to ask her Advice concerning the Government of the Blazing-World:","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"For, said she, although this World was very well and wisely ordered and","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"governed at first, when I came to be Empress thereof; yet the nature of","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Women being much delighted with Change and Variety, after I had received","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"an absolute Power from the Emperor, did somewhat alter the Form of","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,Government from what I found it; but now perceiving that the World is,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"not so quiet as it was at first, I am much troubled at it; especially","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,there are such continual Contentions and Divisions between the Worm-,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Bear- and Fly-men, the Ape-men, the Satyrs, the Spider-men, and all","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"others of such sorts, that I fear they'l break out into an open","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Rebellion, and cause a great disorder; and the ruin of the Government;","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"and therefore I desire your advice and assistance, how I may order it to","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"the best advantage, that this World may be rendred peaceable, quiet and","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"happy, as it was before. Whereupon the Duchess answered, That since she","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"heard by her Imperial Majesty, how well and happily the World had been","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"governed when she first came to be Empress thereof, she would advise her","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Majesty to introduce the same form of Government again, which had been","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"before; that is, to have but one soveraign, one Religion, one Law, and","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"one Language, so that all the World might be but as one united Family,","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"without divisions; nay, like God, and his Blessed Saints and Angels:","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Otherwise, said she, it may in time prove as unhappy, nay, as miserable","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"a World as that is from which I came, wherein are more soveraigns then","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Worlds, and more pretended Governours then Government, more Religions","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"then Gods, and more Opinions in those Religions then Truths; more Laws","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"then Rights, and more Bribes then Justices; more Policies then","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Necessities, and more Fears then Dangers; more Covetousness then Riches,","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"more Ambitions then Merits, more Services then Rewards, more Languages","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"

,"Actions, and more Gifts by partiality, then according to Merit; all","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"which, said she, is a great misery, nay, a curse, which your blessed","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Blazing-World never knew, nor 'tis probable, will never know of, unless","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,your Imperial Majesty alter the Government thereof from what it was when,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,you began to govern it: And since your Majesty complains much of the,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"

,"Spider-men, and the like, and of their perpetual disputes and quarrels,","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,I would advise your Majesty to dissolve all their societies; for 'tis,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"better to be without their intelligences, then to have an unquiet and","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"disorderly Government. The truth is, said she, wheresoever Learning is,","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"

,"that she had received Intelligence from the Spirits, that that part of","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"

,"being very sensible of this ill news, especially of the Trouble it","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"caused to the Empress, endeavoured to comfort her as much as possibly he","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"could; and told her, that she might have all the assistance which the","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Blazing-World was able to afford. she answered, That if there were any","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"possibility of transporting Forces out of the Blazing-World, into the","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"World she came from, she would not fear so much the ruin thereof: but,","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"said she, there being no probability of effecting anysuch thing, I know","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,not how to shew my readiness to serve my Native Country. The Emperor,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"asked, Whether those Spirits that gave her Intelligence of this War,","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"could not with all their Power and Forces, assist her against those","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Enemies? she answered, That Spirits could not arm themselves, nor make","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,any use of Artificial Arms or Weapons; for their Vehicles were Natural,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Bodies, not Artificial: Besides, said she, the violent and strong","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"actions of war, will never agree with Immaterial Spirits; for Immaterial","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Spirits cannot fight, nor make Trenches, Fortifications, and the like.","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"But, said the Emperor, their Vehicles can; especially if those Vehicles","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"be mens Bodies, they may be serviceable in all the actions of War. Alas,","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"replied the Empress, that will never do; for first, said she, it will be","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"difficult to get so many dead Bodies for their Vehicles, as to make up a","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"whole Army, much more to make many Armies to fight with so many several","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Nations; nay, if this could be, yet it is not possible to get so many","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,dead and undissolved Bodies in one Nation; and for transporting them out,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"of other Nations, it would be a thing of great difficulty and","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"improbability: But put the case, said she, all these difficulties could","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,be overcome; yet there is one obstruction or hindrance which can no ways,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,be avoided: For although those dead and undissolved Bodies did all die,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"in one minute of time; yet before they could Rendezvouze, and be put","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"into a posture of War, to make a great and formidable Army, they would","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"stink and dissolve; and when they came to a fight, they would moulder","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"into dust and ashes, and so leave the purer Immaterial Spirits naked:","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"nay, were it also possible, that those dead bodies could be preserved","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"from stinking and dissolving, yet the Souls of such Bodies would not","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"suffer Immaterial Spirits to rule and order them, but they would enter","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"and govern them themselves, as being the right owners thereof, which","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"would produce a War between those Immaterial Souls, and the Immaterial","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"

,"Soul I could advise any manner or way, that you might be able to assist","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,it; but you having told me of your dear Platonick Friend the Duchess of,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Newcastle and of her good and profitable Counsels, I would desire you to","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"send for her Soul, and conferr with her about this business.","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"The Empress was very glad of this motion of the Emperor, and immediately","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"sent for the Soul of the said Duchess, which in a minute waited on her","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,Majesty. Then the Empress declared to her the grievance and sadness of,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"her mind, and how much she was troubled and afflicted at the News","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"brought her by the Immaterial Spirits, desiring the Duchess, if","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"possible, to assist her with the best Counsels she could, that she might","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,shew the greatness of her love and affection which she bore to her,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,Native Countrey. Whereupon the Duchess promised her Majesty to do what,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"lay in her power; and since it was a business of great Importance, she","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"desired some time to consider of it; for, said she, Great Affairs","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,require deep Considerations; which the Empress willingly allowed her.,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"And after the Duchess had considered some little time, she desired the","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Empress to send some of her Syrens or Mear men, to see what passages","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"they could find out of the Blazing-World, into the World she came from;","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"for, said she, if there be a passage for a Ship to come out of that","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,World into this; then certainly there may also a Ship pass thorow the,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,same passage out of this World into that. Hereupon the Mear- or Fish-men,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"were sent out; who being many in number, employ'd all their industry,","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"and did swim several ways; at last having found out the passage, they","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"returned to the Empress, and told her, That as their Blazing World had","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"but one Emperor, one Government, one Religion, and one Language, so","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"there was but one Passage into that World, which was so little, that no","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,Vessel bigger than a Packet-Boat could go thorow; neither was that,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Passage always open, but sometimes quite frozen up. At which Relation","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"both the Empress and Duchess seemed somewhat troubled, fearing that this","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,would perhaps be an hindrance or obstruction to their Design.,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"At last the Duchess desired the Empress to send for her Ship-wrights,","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"and all her Architects, which were Giants; who being called, the Duchess","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"told them how some in her own World had been so ingenious, as to","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"contrive Ships that could swim under Water, and asked, Whether they","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"could do the like? The Giants answered, They had never heard of that","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Invention; nevertheless, they would try what might be done by Art, and","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"spare no labour or industry to find it out. In the mean time, while both","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"the Empress and Duchess were in a serious Counsel, after many debates,","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,the Duchess desired but a few Ships to transport some of the Bird- Worm-,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"and Bear- men: Alas! said the Empress, What can such sorts of Men do in","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"the other World? especially so few? They will be soon destroyed, for a","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Musket will destroy numbers of Birds in one shot. The Duchess said, I","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"desire your Majesty will have but a little patience, and relie upon my","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"advice, and you shall not fail to save your own Native Country, and in a","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"manner become a Mistress of all that World you came from. The Empress,","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"who loved the Duchess as her own Soul, did so; the Giants returned soon","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"after, and told her Majesty, that they had found out the Art which the","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Duchess had mentioned, to make such Ships as could swim under water;","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"which the Empress and Duchess were both very glad at, and when the Ships","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"were made ready, the Duchess told the Empress, that it was requisite","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"that her Majesty should go her self in body, as well as in Soul; but I,","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"said she, can onely wait on your Majesty after a Spiritual manner, that","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"is, with my Soul. Your Soul, said the Empress, shall live with my Soul,","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,in my Body; for I shall onely desire your Counsel and Advice. Then said,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"the Duchess, Your Majesty must command a great number of your Fish-men","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,to wait on your Ships; for you know that your Ships are not made for,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Cannons, and therefore are no ways serviceable in War; for though by the","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"help of your Engines, they can drive on, and your Fish-men may by the","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"help of Chains and Ropes, draw them which way they will, to make them go","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"on, or flye back, yet not so as to fight: And though your Ships be of","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Gold, and cannot be shot thorow, but onely bruised and battered; yet the","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Enemy will assault and enter them, and take them as Prizes; wherefore","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"your Fish-men must do you Service instead of Cannons. But how, said the","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Empress, can the Fish-men do me service against an Enemy, without","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Cannons and all sorts of Arms? That is the reason, answered the Duchess,","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"that I would have numbers of Fish-men, for they shall destroy all your","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Enemies Ships, before they can come near you. The Empress asked in what","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"manner that could be? Thus, answered the Duchess: Your Majesty must send","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,a number of Worm-men to the Burning-Mountains (for you have good store,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,of them in the Blazing-World) which must get a great quantity of the,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Fire-stone, whose property, you know, is, that it burns so long as it is","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"wet; and the Ships in the other World being all made of Wood, they may","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,by that means set them all on fire; and if you can but destroy their,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Ships, and hinder their Navigation, you will be Mistress of all that","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"World, by reason most parts thereof cannot live without Navigation.","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Besides, said she, the Fire-stone will serve you instead of Light or","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Torches; for you know, that the World you are going into, is dark at","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"nights (especially if there be no Moon-shine, or if the Moon be","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,overshadowed by Clouds) and not so full of Blazing-Stars as this World,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"is, which make as great a light in the absence of the Sun, as the Sun","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"doth when it is present; for that World hath but little blinking Stars,","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"which make more shadows then light, and are onely able to draw up","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Vapours from the Earth, but not to rarifie or clarifie them, or to","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,convert them into serene air.,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,This Advice of the Duchess was very much approved; and joyfully embraced,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"by the Empress, who forthwith sent her Worm-men to get a good quantity","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,of the mentioned Fire-stone. she also commanded numbers of Fish-men to,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"wait on her under Water, and Bird-men to wait on her in the Air; and","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Bear- and Worm-men to wait on her in Ships, according to the Duchess's","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"advice; and indeed the Bear-men were as serviceable to her, as the North","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,Star; but the Bird-men would often rest themselves upon the Deck of the,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Ships; neither would the Empress, being of a sweet and noble Nature,","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,suffer that they should tire or weary themselves by long flights; for,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"though by Land they did often fly out of one Countrey into another, yet","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"they did rest in some Woods, or on some Grounds, especially at night,","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,when it was their sleeping time: And therefore the Empress was forced to,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"take a great many Ships along with her, both for transporting those","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"several sorts of her loyal and serviceable Subjects, and to carry","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"provisions for them: Besides, she was so wearied with the Petitions of","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"several others of her Subjects who desired to wait on her Majesty, that","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,she could not possibly deny them all; for some would rather chuse to be,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"drowned, then not tender their duty to her.","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Thus after all things were made fit and ready, the Empress began her","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Journey; I cannot properly say, she set Sail, by reason in some Part, as","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,in the passage between the two Worlds (which yet was but short) the,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Ships were drawn under water by the Fish-men with Golden Chains, so that","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"they had no need of Sails there, nor of any other Arts, but onely to","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"keep out water from entering into the Ships, and to give or make so much","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Air as would serve, for breath or respiration, those Land-Animals that","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"were in the Ships; which the Giants had so Artificially contrived, that","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"they which were therein, found no inconveniency at all: And after they","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"had passed the Icy Sea, the Golden Ships appeared above Water, and so","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,went on until they came near the Kingdom that was the Empress's Native,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,Countrey; where the Bear-men through their Telescopes discovered a great,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"

,"The Empress before she came in sight of the Enemy, sent some of her","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,Fish- and Bird-men to bring her intelligence of their Fleet; and hearing,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"of their number, their station and posture, she gave order that when it","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"was Night, her Bird-men should carry in their beeks some of the","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"mentioned Fire-stones, with the tops thereof wetted; and the Fish-men","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"should carry them likewise, and hold them out of the Water; for they","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"were cut in the form of Torches or Candles, and being many thousands,","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,made a terrible shew; for it appear'd as if all the Air and Sea had been,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"of a Flaming-Fire; and all that were upon the Sea, or near it, did","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"

,"let them know, that she was a great and powerful Princess, and came to","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"

,"Opinions: besides, every Councellor striving to be the wisest, makes","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"

,"long-speeched Councellors, replied the Empress, I would hang them, by","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"

,"Majesty should not be angry, but consider the differences of that and","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"

,Judgments did this produce in the minds of her Country-men! some said,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"

,"word, that although she did partly destroy his Enemies by Sea, yet, they","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"were so powerful, that they did hinder the Trade and Traffick of his","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Dominions. To which the Empress returned this answer, That she would","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"

,"Sea, desiring them to pay Tribute to the King and soveraign of that","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,Nation where she was born; But they denied it with great scorn.,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"

,"Master of the Seas, and consequently of that World; by reason, as I","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"mentioned heretofore, the several Nations of that World could not well","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"

,"reduce them by force, to what they would not yield with a good will. But","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"they rejected and scorned her Majesties Message, which provoked her","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"anger so much, that she resolved to send her Bird- and Worm men thither,","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"with order to begin first with their smaller Towns, and set them on fire","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,(for she was loath to make more spoil then she was forced to do) and if,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"they remain'd still obstinate in their resolutions, to destroy also","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"their greater Cities. The onely difficulty was, how to convey the","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,Worm-men conveniently to those places; but they desired that her Majesty,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"would but set them upon any part of the Earth of those Nations, and they","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"could travel within the Earth as easily, and as nimbly as men upon the","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,face of the Earth; which the Empress did according to their desire.,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"

,"But before both the Bird- and Worm-men began their journey, the Empress","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,commanded the Bear-men to view through their Telescopes what Towns and,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,Cities those were that would not submit; and having a full information,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"thereof, she instructed the Bird- and Bear-men what Towns they should","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,begin withal; in the mean while she sent to all the Princes and,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"soveraigns of those Nations, to let them know that she would give them a","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"proof of her Power, and check their Obstinacies by burning some of their","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,smaller Towns; and if they continued still in their Obstinate,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Resolutions, that she would convert their smaller Loss into a Total","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Ruin. She also commanded her Bird-men to make their flight at night,","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,lest they be perceived. At last when both the Bird- and Worm-men came to,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"the designed places, the Worm-men laid some Fire-stones under the","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Foundation of every House, and the Bird-men placed some at the tops of","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"them, so that both by rain, and by some other moisture within the Earth,","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,the stones could not fail of burning. The Bird-men in the mean time,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"

,"next time it did rain, their Towns would be all on fire; at which they","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,were amaz'd to hear Men speak in the air; but withall they laughed when,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,they heard them say that rain should fire their Towns; knowing that the,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"effect of Water was to quench, not produce Fire.","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"

,"flaming Fire; and the more Water there was poured on them, the more they","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,did flame and burn; which struck such a Fright and Terror into all the,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Neighbouring Cities, Nations and Kingdoms, that for fear the like should","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"happen to them, they and all the rest of the parts of that World,","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"granted the Empress's desire, and submitted to the Monarch and sovereign","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"of her Native Countrey, the King of Esfi; save one, which having seldom","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"or never any rain, but onely dews, which would soon be spent in a great","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"fire, slighted her Power: The Empress being desirous to make it stoop as","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"well as the rest, knew that every year it was watered by a flowing Tide,","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,which lasted some Weeks; and although their Houses stood high from the,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"ground, yet they were built upon Supporters which were fixt into the","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,ground. Wherefore she commanded both her Bird- and Worm-men to lay some,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"of the Fire-stones at the bottom of those Supporters, and when the Tide","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"came in, all their Houses were of a Fire, which did so rarifie the","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Water, that the Tide was soon turn'd into a Vapour, and this Vapour","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"again into Air; which caused not onely a destruction of their Houses,","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"but also a general barrenness over all their Countrey that year, and","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"forced them to submit, as well as the rest of the World had done.","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Thus the Empress did not onely save her Native Country, but made it the","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,Absolute Monarchy of all that World; and both the effects of her Power,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"

,"Blazing-World, they all entreated the favour, that they might wait on","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"

,glad to grant their Requests; but having no other place of Reception for,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"them, she desired that they would be pleased to come into the open Seas","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"with their Ships, and make a Circle of a pretty large compass, and then","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"

,"her Imperial Robes; in some part of her hair, near her face, she had","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"placed some of the Starr- Stone, which added such a luster and glory to","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"it, that it caused a great admiration in all that were present, who","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"believed her to be some Celestial Creature, or rather an uncreated","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Goddess, and they all had a desire to worship her; for surely, said","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"they, no mortal creature can have such a splendid and transcendent","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"beauty, nor can any have so great a power as she has, to walk upon the","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Waters, and to destroy whatever she pleases, not onely whole Nations,","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,but a whole World.,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"The Empress expressed to her own Countrymen, who were also her","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Interpreters to the rest of the Princes that were present, That she","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,would give them an Entertainment at the darkest time of Night: Which,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"being come, the Fire-Stones were lighted, which made both Air and Seas","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"appear of a bright shining flame, insomuch that they put all Spectators","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"into an extream fright, who verily believed they should all be","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"destroyed; which the Empress perceiving, caused all the Lights of the","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Fire-Stones to be put out, and onely shewed her self in her Garments of","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Light. The Bird-men carried her upon their backs into the Air, and there","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,she appear'd as glorious as the Sun. Then she was set down upon the Seas,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"again, and presently there was heard the most melodious and sweetest","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Consort of Voices, as ever was heard out of the Seas, which was made by","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"the Fish- men; this Consort was answered by another, made by the","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Bird-men in the Air, so that it seem'd as if Sea and Air had spoke, and","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"

,"But when it was upon break of day, the Empress ended her Entertainment,","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,and at full day-light all the Princes perceived that she went into the,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Ship wherein the Prince and Monarch of her Native Country was, the King","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"of Esfi, with whom she had several Conferences; and having assured Him","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"of the readiness of her Assistance whensoever he required it, telling","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Him withal, That she wanted no Intelligence, she went forth again upon","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"the Waters, and being in the midst of the Circle made by those Ships","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"that were present, she desired them to draw somewhat nearer, that they","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"might hear her speak; which being done, she declared her self in this","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,following manner:,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Great, Heroick, and Famous Monarchs, I come hither to assist the King of","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Esfi against his Enemies, He being unjustly assaulted by many several","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Nations, which would fain take away His Hereditary Rights, and","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Prerogatives of the Narrow Seas; at which Unjustice, Heaven was much","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"displeased, and for the Injuries He received from His Enemies, rewarded","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Him with an Absolute Power, so that now he is become the Head-Monarch of","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"all this World; which Power, though you may envy, yet you can no wayes","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"hinder Him; for all those that endeavour to resist His Power, shall","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"onely get Loss for their Labour, and no Victory for their Profit.","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Wherefore my advice to you all is, To pay him Tribute justly and truly,","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"

,Blessings of Heaven: which I wish you from my Soul.,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,After the Empress had thus finished her Speech to the Princes of the,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"several Nations of that World, she desired that in their Ships might","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"fall back; which being done, her own Fleet came into the Circle, without","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,any visible assistance of Sails or Tide; and her self being entred into,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"her own Ship, the whole Fleet sunk immediately into the bottom of the","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Seas, and left all the Spectators in a deep amazement; neither would she","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"suffer any of her Ships to come above the Waters, until she arrived into","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,the Blazing-World.,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"In time of the Voyage, both the Empress's and the Duchess's Soul, were","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,very gay and merry; and sometimes they would converse very seriously,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"with each other. Amongst the rest of their discourses, the Duchess said,","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"she wondred much at one thing, which was, That since her Majesty had","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"found out a passage out of the Blazing-World, into the World she came","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"from, she did not enrich that part of the World where she was born, at","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"least her own Family, though she had enough to enrich the whole World.","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"The Empress's Soul answered, That she loved her Native Countrey, and her","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"own Family, as well as any Creature could do; and that this was the","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"reason why she would not enrich them: for, said she, not only particular","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Families or Nations, but all the World, their Natures are such, that","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"much Gold, and great store of Riches, makes them mad; insomuch as they","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,endeavour to destroy each other for Gold or Riches sake. The reason,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"thereof is, said the Duchess, that they have too little Gold and Riches,","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"which makes them so eager to have it. No, replied the Empress's Soul,","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"their particular Covetousness, is beyond all the wealth of the richest","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"World, and the more Riches they have, the more Covetous they are; for","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"their Covetousness is Infinite. But, said she, I would there could a","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Passage be found out of the Blazing-World, into the World whence you","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"came, and I would willingly give you as much Riches as you desir'd. The","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,Duchess's Soul gave her Majesty humble thanks for her great Favour; and,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"told her, that she was not covetous, nor desir'd any more wealth than","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"what her Lord and Husband had before the Civil-Warrs. Neither, said she,","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"should I desire it for my own, but my Lord's Posterities sake. Well,","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"said the Empress, I'le command my Fish-men to use all their Skill and","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,Industry to find out a Passage into that World which your Lord and,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Husband is in. I do verily believe, answered the Duchess, that there","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"will be no Passage found into that World; but if there were any, I","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"should not Petition your Majesty for Gold and Jewels, but only for the","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Elixir that grows in the midst of the Golden Sands, for to preserve Life","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"and Health; but without a Passage, it is impossible to carry away any of","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"it: for, whatsoever is Material, cannot travel like Immaterial Beings,","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,such as Souls and Spirits are. Neither do Souls require any such thing,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"that might revive them, or prolong their Lives, by reason they are","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"unalterable: for, were Souls like Bodies, then my Soul might have had","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,the benefit of that Natural Elixir that grows in your Blazing-World. I,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"wish earnestly, said the Empress, that a Passage might be found, and","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"then both your Lord and your self, should neither want Wealth, nor","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Long-life: nay, I love you so well, that I would make you as Great and","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Powerful a Monarchess, as I am of the Blazing-World. The Duchess's Soul","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"humbly thank'd her Majesty, and told her, That she acknowledged and","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,esteemed her Love beyond all things that are in Nature.,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"After this Discourse, they had many other Conferences, which for","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"brevity's sake I'le forbear to rehearse. At last, after several","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Questions which the Empress's Soul asked the Duchess, she desired to","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"know the reason why she did take such delight, when she was joyned to","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"her Body, in being singular both in Accoustrements, Behaviour, and","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Discourse? The Duchess's Soul answered, she confessed that it was","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"extravagant, and beyond what was usual and ordinary: but yet her","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"ambition being such, that she would not be like others in any thing, if","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"it were possible, I endeavour, said she, to be as singular as I can:","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"for, it argues but a mean Nature, to imitate others: and though I do not","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"love to be imitated, if I can possibly avoid it; yet, rather than","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"imitate others, I should chuse to be imitated by others: for my Nature","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"is such, that I had rather appear worse in Singularity, than better in","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"the Mode. If you were not a great Lady, replied the Empress, you would","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"never pass in the World for a wise Lady: for, the World would say, your","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Singularities are Vanities. The Duchess's Soul answered, she did not at","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"all regard the Censure of this, or any other Age, concerning Vanities:","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"but, said she, neither this present, nor any of the future Ages, can or","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"will truly say, that I am not Vertuous and Chast: for I am confident,","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"all that were, or are acquainted with me, and all the Servants which","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"ever I had, will or can upon their oaths declare my actions no otherwise","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"than Vertuous: and certainly, there's none even of the meanest Degree,","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"which have not their Spies and Witnesses, much more those of the Nobler","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"sort, which seldom or never are without Attendants; so that their Faults","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"(if they have any) will easily be known, and as easily be divulged.","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Wherefore, happy are those Natures that are Honest, Vertuous, and Noble;","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"not only happy to themselves, but happy to their Families. But, said the","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Empress, if you glory so much in your Honesty and Vertue, how comes it","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"that you plead for Dishonest and Wicked persons, in your Writings? The","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Duchess answered, It was only to shew her Wit, not her Nature.","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"At last the Empress arrived into the Blazing-World, and coming to her","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Imperial Palace, you may sooner imagine than expect that I should","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,express the joy which the Emperor had at her safe return; for he loved,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"her beyond his Soul; and there was no love lost, for the Empress equal'd","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,his Affection with no less love to him. After the time of rejoicing with,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"each other, the Duchess's Soul begg'd leave to return to her Noble Lord:","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"But the Emperor desired, that before she departed, she would see how he","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,had employed his time in the Empress's absence; for he had built Stables,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"and Riding-Houses, and desired to have Horses of Manage, such as,","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"according to the Empress's Relation, the Duke of Newcastlehad: The","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Emperor enquired of the Duchess, the Form and Structure of her Lord and","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Husband's Stables and Riding-House. The Duchess answer'd his Majesty,","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"That they were but plain and ordinary; but, said she, had my Lord","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Wealth, I am sure he would not spare it, in rendring his Buildings as","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,Noble as could be made. Hereupon the Emperor shewed the Duchess the,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Stables he had built, which were most stately and magnificent; among the","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"rest, there was one double Stable that held a Hundred Horses on a side,","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"the main Building was of Gold, lined with several sorts of precious","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Materials; the Roof was Arched with Agats, the sides of the Walls were","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"lined with Cornelian, the Floor was paved with Amber, the Mangers were","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Mother of Pearl; the Pillars, as also the middle Isle or Walk of the","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Stables, were of Crystal; the Front and Gate was of Turquois, most","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"neatly cut and carved. The Riding-House was lined with Saphirs, Topases,","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"and the like; the Floor was all of Golden-Sand so finely sifted, that it","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"was extreamly soft, and not in the least hurtful to the Horses feet, and","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,the Door and Frontispiece was of Emeralds curiously carved.,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"After the view of these Glorious and Magnificent Buildings, which the","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Duchess's Soul was much delighted withall, she resolved to take her","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"leave; but the Emperor desired her to stay yet some short time more, for","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"they both loved her company so well, that they were unwilling to have","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,her depart so soon: several Conferences and Discourses pass'd between,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"them; amongst the rest, the Emperor desir'd her advice how to set up a","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Theatre for Plays. The Duchess confessed her Ignorance in this Art,","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,telling his Majesty that she knew nothing of erecting Theatres or,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Scenes, but what she had by an Immaterial Observation, when she was with","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,the Empress's Soul in the chief City of E. Entring into one of their,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Theatres, whereof the Empress could give as much account to his Majesty,","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"as her self. But both the Emperor and the Empress told the Duchess, That","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"she could give directions how to make Plays. The Duchess answered, That","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"she had as little skill to form a Play after the Mode, as she had to","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"paint or make a Scene for shew. But you have made Plays, replied the","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Empress: Yes, answered the Duchess, I intended them for Plays; but the","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,Wits of these present times condemned them as uncapable of being,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"represented or acted, because they were not made up according to the","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Rules of Art; though I dare say, That the Descriptions are as good as","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"any they have writ. The Emperor asked, Whether the Property of Plays","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"were not to describe the several Humours, Actions and Fortunes of","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Mankind? 'Tis so, answered the Duchess. Why then, replied the Emperor,","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"the natural Humours, Actions and Fortunes of Mankind, are not done by","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"the Rules of Art: But, said the Duchess, it is the Art and Method of our","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Wits to despise all Descriptions of Wit, Humour, Actions and Fortunes","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"that are without such Artificial Rules. The Emperor asked, Are those","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,good Plays that are made so Methodically and Artificially? The Duchess,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"answer'd, They were Good according to the Judgment of the Age, or Mode","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"of the Nation, but not according to her Judgment: for truly, said she,","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"in my Opinion, their Plays will prove a Nursery of whining Lovers, and","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"not an Academy or School for Wise, Witty, Noble and well-behaved men.","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"But I, replied the Emperor, desire such a Theatre as may make wise Men;","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"and will have such Descriptions as are Natural, not Artificial. If your","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Majesty be of that Opinion, said the Duchess's Soul, then my Playes may","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"be acted in your Blazing- World, when they cannot be acted in the","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Blinking-World of Wit; and the next time I come to visit your Majesty, I","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"shall endeavour to order your Majesty's Theatre, to present such Playes","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"as my Wit is capable to make. Then the Empress told the Duchess, That","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"she loved a foolish Farse added to a wise Play. The Duchess answered,","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,That no World in Nature had fitter Creatures for it than the,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Blazing-World: for, said she, the Lowse- men, the Bird-men, the Spider-","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"and Fox-men, the Ape-men and Satyrs appear in a Farse extraordinary","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,pleasant.,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,Hereupon both the Emperor and Empress intreated the Duchess's Soul to,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"stay so long with them, till she had ordered her Theatre, and made","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,Playes and Farses fit for them; for they onely wanted that sort of,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,Recreation: but the Duchess's Soul begg'd their Majesties to give her,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,leave to go into her Native World; for she long'd to be with her dear,"Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"Lord and Husband, promising, that after a short time she would return","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
,"again. Which being granted, though with much difficulty, she took her","Cavendish, Margaret","The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World"
