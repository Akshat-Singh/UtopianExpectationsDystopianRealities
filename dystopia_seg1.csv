4560,"Rand, Ayn",Anthem,8,sentence,571,660,229:244,NA,So we called International       48818 and together we scraped the earth around the bar
4561,"Rand, Ayn",Anthem,9,sentence,662,761,245:266,NA,Of a       sudden the earth fell in before us and we saw an old iron grill       over a black hole

4563,"Rand, Ayn",Anthem,11,sentence,804,852,272:282,NA,But we pulled at the grill and       it gave way
4564,"Rand, Ayn",Anthem,12,sentence,854,947,283:300,NA,And then we saw iron rings as steps leading down a       shaft into a darkness without bottom
4565,"Rand, Ayn",Anthem,13,sentence,955,1010,301:314,NA,We shall go down we said to International 48818

4569,"Rand, Ayn",Anthem,17,sentence,1274,1340,367:378,NA,And everything which       is not permitted by law is forbidden
4570,"Rand, Ayn",Anthem,18,sentence,1348,1393,379:392,NA,But we said We shall go none the less
4571,"Rand, Ayn",Anthem,19,sentence,1401,1458,393:405,NA,They were frightened but they stood by and watched us go
4572,"Rand, Ayn",Anthem,20,sentence,1466,1519,406:418,NA,We hung on the iron rings with our hands and our feet
4573,"Rand, Ayn",Anthem,21,sentence,1521,1556,419:425,NA,We could       see nothing below us
4574,"Rand, Ayn",Anthem,22,sentence,1558,1675,426:450,NA,And above us the hole open upon the sky       grew smaller and smaller till it came to be the size of a       button
4575,"Rand, Ayn",Anthem,23,sentence,1677,1699,451:456,NA,But still we went down
4576,"Rand, Ayn",Anthem,24,sentence,1701,1733,457:463,NA,Then our foot touched the ground
4577,"Rand, Ayn",Anthem,25,sentence,1741,1781,464:474,NA,We rubbed our eyes for we could not see
4578,"Rand, Ayn",Anthem,26,sentence,1783,1868,475:492,NA,Then our eyes became       used to the darkness but we could not believe what we saw
4579,"Rand, Ayn",Anthem,27,sentence,1876,2012,493:523,NA,No men known to us could have built this place nor the men known       to our brothers who lived before us and yet it was built by men
4580,"Rand, Ayn",Anthem,28,sentence,2020,2041,524:529,NA,It was a great tunnel
4581,"Rand, Ayn",Anthem,29,sentence,2043,2134,530:550,NA,Its walls were hard and smooth to the       touch it felt like stone but it was not stone

4583,"Rand, Ayn",Anthem,31,sentence,2254,2357,576:597,NA,We knelt and we crawled forward our       hand groping along the iron line to see where it would lead
4584,"Rand, Ayn",Anthem,32,sentence,2359,2402,598:605,NA,But       there was an unbroken night ahead
4585,"Rand, Ayn",Anthem,33,sentence,2404,2490,606:622,NA,Only the iron tracks glowed       through it straight and white calling us to follow
4586,"Rand, Ayn",Anthem,34,sentence,2492,2577,623:639,NA,But we       could not follow for we were losing the puddle of light behind       us
4587,"Rand, Ayn",Anthem,35,sentence,2579,2638,640:654,NA,So we turned and we crawled back our hand on the iron line
4588,"Rand, Ayn",Anthem,36,sentence,2646,2698,655:665,NA,And our heart beat in our fingertips without reason
4589,"Rand, Ayn",Anthem,37,sentence,2700,2722,666:670,NA,And then we       knew

4591,"Rand, Ayn",Anthem,39,sentence,2808,2890,684:702,NA,So it was true and those Times had been and all the       wonders of those Times
4592,"Rand, Ayn",Anthem,40,sentence,2892,2969,703:716,NA,Hundreds upon hundreds of years ago men       knew secrets which we have lost
4593,"Rand, Ayn",Anthem,41,sentence,2971,3016,717:726,NA,And we thought This is a foul       place
4594,"Rand, Ayn",Anthem,42,sentence,3018,3090,727:739,NA,They are damned who touch the things of the Unmentionable       Times
4595,"Rand, Ayn",Anthem,43,sentence,3092,3317,740:785,NA,But our hand which followed the track as we crawled       clung to the iron as if it would not leave it as if the skin of       our hand were thirsty and begging of the metal some secret fluid       beating in its coldness
4596,"Rand, Ayn",Anthem,44,sentence,3325,3349,786:791,NA,We returned to the earth
4597,"Rand, Ayn",Anthem,45,sentence,3351,3409,792:800,NA,International 48818 looked upon us and       stepped back

4601,"Rand, Ayn",Anthem,49,sentence,3593,3669,838:855,NA,Then they       smiled but it was not a gay smile it was lost and pleading
4602,"Rand, Ayn",Anthem,50,sentence,3671,3705,856:862,NA,But       still we could not speak
4603,"Rand, Ayn",Anthem,51,sentence,3707,3817,863:885,NA,Then they said       We shall report our find to the City Council and both of us will       be rewarded
4604,"Rand, Ayn",Anthem,52,sentence,3825,3842,886:890,NA,And then we spoke
4605,"Rand, Ayn",Anthem,53,sentence,3844,3904,891:903,NA,Our voice was hard and there was no mercy in       our voice
4606,"Rand, Ayn",Anthem,54,sentence,3906,3972,904:918,NA,We said       We shall not report our find to the City Council

4611,"Rand, Ayn",Anthem,59,sentence,4350,4385,990:999,NA,Then we said keep silent
