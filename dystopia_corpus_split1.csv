17,      It is a sin to write this. It is a sin to think words no others,Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
18,      think and to put them down upon a paper no others are to see. It,Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
19,      is base and evil. It is as if we were speaking alone to no ears,Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
20,      but our own. And we know well that there is no transgression,Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
21,      blacker than to do or think alone. We have broken the laws. The,Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
22,      laws say that men may not write unless the Council of Vocations,Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
23,      bid them so. May we be forgiven!,Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
24,      But this is not the only sin upon us. We have committed a greater,Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
25,"      crime, and for this crime there is no name. What punishment",Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
26,"      awaits us if it be discovered we know not, for no such crime has",Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
27,      come in the memory of men and there are no laws to provide for,Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
28,      it.,Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
29,      It is dark here. The flame of the candle stands still in the air.,Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
30,      Nothing moves in this tunnel save our hand on the paper. We are,Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
31,"      alone here under the earth. It is a fearful word, alone. The laws",Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
32,"      say that none among men may be alone, ever and at any time, for",Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
33,      this is the great transgression and the root of all evil. But we,Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
34,      have broken many laws. And now there is nothing here save our one,Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
35,"      body, and it is strange to see only two legs stretched on the",Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
36,"      ground, and on the wall before us the shadow of our one head.",Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
37,      The walls are cracked and water runs upon them in thin threads,Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
38,"      without sound, black and glistening as blood. We stole the candle",Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
39,      from the larder of the Home of the Street Sweepers. We shall be,Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
40,      sentenced to ten years in the Palace of Corrective Detention if,Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
41,      it be discovered. But this matters not. It matters only that the,Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
42,      light is precious and we should not waste it to write when we,Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
43,      need it for that work which is our crime. Nothing matters save,Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
44,"      the work, our secret, our evil, our precious work. Still, we must",Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
45,"      also write, forîmay the Council have mercy upon us!îwe wish to",Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
46,      speak for once to no ears but our own.,Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
47,"      Our name is Equality 7-2521, as it is written on the iron",Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
48,      bracelet which all men wear on their left wrists with their names,Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
49,"      upon it. We are twenty-one years old. We are six feet tall, and",Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
50,"      this is a burden, for there are not many men who are six feet",Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
51,      tall. Ever have the Teachers and the Leaders pointed to us and,Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
52,      frowned and said:,Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
53,"      There is evil in your bones, Equality 7-2521, for your body has",Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
54,      grown beyond the bodies of your brothers.ù But we cannot change,Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
55,      our bones nor our body.,Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
56,      We were born with a curse. It has always driven us to thoughts,Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
57,      which are forbidden. It has always given us wishes which men may,Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
58,"      not wish. We know that we are evil, but there is no will in us",Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
59,      and no power to resist it. This is our wonder and our secret,Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
60,"      fear, that we know and do not resist.",Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
61,"      We strive to be like all our brother men, for all men must be",Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
62,"      alike. Over the portals of the Palace of the World Council, there",Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
63,"      are words cut in the marble, which we repeat to ourselves",Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
64,      whenever we are tempted:,Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
65,  WE ARE ONE IN ALL AND ALL IN ONE.,Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
66,"  THERE ARE NO MEN BUT ONLY THE GREAT _WE_,",Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
67,"  ONE, INDIVISIBLE AND FOREVER.ù",Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
68,"      We repeat this to ourselves, but it helps us not.",Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
69,      These words were cut long ago. There is green mould in the,Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
70,"      grooves of the letters and yellow streaks on the marble, which",Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
71,      come from more years than men could count. And these words are,Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
72,"      the truth, for they are written on the Palace of the World",Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
73,"      Council, and the World Council is the body of all truth. Thus has",Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
74,"      it been ever since the Great Rebirth, and farther back than that",Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
75,      no memory can reach.,Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
76,"      But we must never speak of the times before the Great Rebirth,",Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
77,      else we are sentenced to three years in the Palace of Corrective,Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
78,      Detention. It is only the Old Ones who whisper about it in the,Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
79,"      evenings, in the Home of the Useless. They whisper many strange",Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
80,"      things, of the towers which rose to the sky, in those",Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
81,"      Unmentionable Times, and of the wagons which moved without",Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
82,"      horses, and of the lights which burned without flame. But those",Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
83,"      times were evil. And those times passed away, when men saw the",Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
84,      Great Truth which is this: that all men are one and that there is,Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
85,      no will save the will of all men together.,Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
86,"      All men are good and wise. It is only we, Equality 7-2521, we",Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
87,      alone who were born with a curse. For we are not like our,Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
88,"      brothers. And as we look back upon our life, we see that it has",Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
89,      ever been thus and that it has brought us step by step to our,Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
90,"      last, supreme transgression, our crime of crimes hidden here",Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
91,      under the ground.,Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
92,      We remember the Home of the Infants where we lived till we were,Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
93,"      five years old, together with all the children of the City who",Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
94,      had been born in the same year. The sleeping halls there were,Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
95,      white and clean and bare of all things save one hundred beds. We,Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
96,"      were just like all our brothers then, save for the one",Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
97,      transgression: we fought with our brothers. There are few,Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
98,"      offenses blacker than to fight with our brothers, at any age and",Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
99,"      for any cause whatsoever. The Council of the Home told us so, and",Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
100,"      of all the children of that year, we were locked in the cellar",Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
101,      most often.,Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
102,"      When we were five years old, we were sent to the Home of the",Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
103,"      Students, where there are ten wards, for our ten years of",Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
104,      learning. Men must learn till they reach their fifteenth year.,Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
105,      Then they go to work. In the Home of the Students we arose when,Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
106,      the big bell rang in the tower and we went to our beds when it,Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
107,"      rang again. Before we removed our garments, we stood in the great",Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
108,"      sleeping hall, and we raised our right arms, and we said all",Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
109,      together with the three Teachers at the head:,Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
110,      We are nothing. Mankind is all. By the grace of our brothers are,Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
111,"      we allowed our lives. We exist through, by and for our brothers",Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
112,      who are the State. Amen.ù,Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
113,      Then we slept. The sleeping halls were white and clean and bare,Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
114,      of all things save one hundred beds.,Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
115,"      We, Equality 7-2521, were not happy in those years in the Home of",Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
116,      the Students. It was not that the learning was too hard for us.,Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
117,"      It was that the learning was too easy. This is a great sin, to be",Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
118,      born with a head which is too quick. It is not good to be,Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
119,"      different from our brothers, but it is evil to be superior to",Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
120,"      them. The Teachers told us so, and they frowned when they looked",Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
121,      upon us.,Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
122,"      So we fought against this curse. We tried to forget our lessons,",Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
123,      but we always remembered. We tried not to understand what the,Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
124,"      Teachers taught, but we always understood it before the Teachers",Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
125,"      had spoken. We looked upon Union 5-3992, who were a pale boy with",Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
126,"      only half a brain, and we tried to say and do as they did, that",Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
127,"      we might be like them, like Union 5-3992, but somehow the",Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
128,      Teachers knew that we were not. And we were lashed more often,Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
129,      than all the other children.,Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
130,"      The Teachers were just, for they had been appointed by the",Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
131,"      Councils, and the Councils are the voice of all justice, for they",Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
132,"      are the voice of all men. And if sometimes, in the secret",Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
133,"      darkness of our heart, we regret that which befell us on our",Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
134,"      fifteenth birthday, we know that it was through our own guilt. We",Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
135,"      had broken a law, for we had not paid heed to the words of our",Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
136,      Teachers. The Teachers had said to us all:,Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
137,      Dare not choose in your minds the work you would like to do when,Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
138,      you leave the Home of the Students. You shall do that which the,Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
139,      Council of Vocations shall prescribe for you. For the Council of,Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
140,      Vocations knows in its great wisdom where you are needed by your,Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
141,"      brother men, better than you can know it in your unworthy little",Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
142,"      minds. And if you are not needed by your brother man, there is no",Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
143,      reason for you to burden the earth with your bodies.ù,Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
144,"      We knew this well, in the years of our childhood, but our curse",Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
145,      broke our will. We were guilty and we confess it here: we were,Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
146,      guilty of the great Transgression of Preference. We preferred,Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
147,      some work and some lessons to the others. We did not listen well,Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
148,      to the history of all the Councils elected since the Great,Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
149,      Rebirth. But we loved the Science of Things. We wished to know.,Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
150,      We wished to know about all the things which make the earth,Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
151,      around us. We asked so many questions that the Teachers forbade,Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
152,      it.,Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
153,      We think that there are mysteries in the sky and under the water,Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
154,      and in the plants which grow. But the Council of Scholars has,Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
155,"      said that there are no mysteries, and the Council of Scholars",Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
156,      knows all things. And we learned much from our Teachers. We,Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
157,      learned that the earth is flat and that the sun revolves around,Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
158,"      it, which causes the day and the night. We learned the names of",Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
159,      all the winds which blow over the seas and push the sails of our,Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
160,      great ships. We learned how to bleed men to cure them of all,Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
161,      ailments.,Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
162,"      We loved the Science of Things. And in the darkness, in the",Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
163,"      secret hour, when we awoke in the night and there were no",Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
164,"      brothers around us, but only their shapes in the beds and their",Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
165,"      snores, we closed our eyes, and we held our lips shut, and we",Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
166,"      stopped our breath, that no shudder might let our brothers see or",Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
167,"      hear or guess, and we thought that we wished to be sent to the",Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
168,      Home of the Scholars when our time would come.,Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
169,      All the great modern inventions come from the Home of the,Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
170,"      Scholars, such as the newest one, which was found only a hundred",Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
171,"      years ago, of how to make candles from wax and string; also, how",Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
172,"      to make glass, which is put in our windows to protect us from the",Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
173,"      rain. To find these things, the Scholars must study the earth and",Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
174,"      learn from the rivers, from the sands, from the winds and the",Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
175,"      rocks. And if we went to the Home of the Scholars, we could learn",Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
176,"      from these also. We could ask questions of these, for they do not",Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
177,      forbid questions.,Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
178,      And questions give us no rest. We know not why our curse makes us,Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
179,"      seek we know not what, ever and ever. But we cannot resist it. It",Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
180,"      whispers to us that there are great things on this earth of ours,",Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
181,"      and that we can know them if we try, and that we must know them.",Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
182,"      We ask, why must we know, but it has no answer to give us. We",Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
183,      must know that we may know.,Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
184,      So we wished to be sent to the Home of the Scholars. We wished it,Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
185,"      so much that our hands trembled under the blankets in the night,",Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
186,      and we bit our arm to stop that other pain which we could not,Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
187,      endure. It was evil and we dared not face our brothers in the,Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
188,      morning. For men may wish nothing for themselves. And we were,Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
189,      punished when the Council of Vocations came to give us our life,Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
190,      Mandates which tell those who reach their fifteenth year what,Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
191,      their work is to be for the rest of their days.,Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
192,"      The Council of Vocations came on the first day of spring, and",Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
193,      they sat in the great hall. And we who were fifteen and all the,Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
194,      Teachers came into the great hall. And the Council of Vocations,Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
195,"      sat on a high dais, and they had but two words to speak to each",Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
196,"      of the Students. They called the Students names, and when the",Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
197,"      Students stepped before them, one after another, the Council",Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
198,      said: Carpenterù or Doctorù or Cookù or Leader.ù Then each,Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
199,      Student raised their right arm and said: The will of our,Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
200,      brothers be done.ù,Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
201,"      Now if the Council has said Carpenterù or Cook,ù the Students",Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
202,      so assigned go to work and they do not study any further. But if,Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
203,"      the Council has said Leader,ù then those Students go into the",Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
204,"      Home of the Leaders, which is the greatest house in the City, for",Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
205,"      it has three stories. And there they study for many years, so",Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
206,      that they may become candidates and be elected to the City,Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
207,      Council and the State Council and the World Councilîby a free and,Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
208,"      general vote of all men. But we wished not to be a Leader, even",Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
209,      though it is a great honor. We wished to be a Scholar.,Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
210,      So we awaited our turn in the great hall and then we heard the,Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
211,      Council of Vocations call our name: Equality 7-2521.ù We walked,Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
212,"      to the dais, and our legs did not tremble, and we looked up at",Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
213,"      the Council. There were five members of the Council, three of the",Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
214,      male gender and two of the female. Their hair was white and their,Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
215,      faces were cracked as the clay of a dry river bed. They were old.,Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
216,      They seemed older than the marble of the Temple of the World,Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
217,      Council. They sat before us and they did not move. And we saw no,Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
218,      breath to stir the folds of their white togas. But we knew that,Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
219,"      they were alive, for a finger of the hand of the oldest rose,",Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
220,"      pointed to us, and fell down again. This was the only thing which",Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
221,"      moved, for the lips of the oldest did not move as they said:",Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
222,      Street Sweeper.ù,Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
223,      We felt the cords of our neck grow tight as our head rose higher,Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
224,"      to look upon the faces of the Council, and we were happy. We knew",Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
225,"      we had been guilty, but now we had a way to atone for it. We",Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
226,"      would accept our Life Mandate, and we would work for our",Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
227,"      brothers, gladly and willingly, and we would erase our sin",Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
228,"      against them, which they did not know, but we knew. So we were",Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
229,"      happy, and proud of ourselves and of our victory over ourselves.",Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
230,"      We raised our right arm and we spoke, and our voice was the",Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
231,"      clearest, the steadiest voice in the hall that day, and we said:",Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
232,      The will of our brothers be done.ù,Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
233,"      And we looked straight into the eyes of the Council, but their",Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
234,      eyes were as cold blue glass buttons.,Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
235,      So we went into the Home of the Street Sweepers. It is a grey,Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
236,"      house on a narrow street. There is a sundial in its courtyard, by",Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
237,      which the Council of the Home can tell the hours of the day and,Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
238,"      when to ring the bell. When the bell rings, we all arise from our",Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
239,      beds. The sky is green and cold in our windows to the east. The,Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
240,      shadow on the sundial marks off a half-hour while we dress and,Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
241,"      eat our breakfast in the dining hall, where there are five long",Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
242,      tables with twenty clay plates and twenty clay cups on each,Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
243,"      table. Then we go to work in the streets of the City, with our",Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
244,"      brooms and our rakes. In five hours, when the sun is high, we",Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
245,"      return to the Home and we eat our midday meal, for which one-half",Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
246,"      hour is allowed. Then we go to work again. In five hours, the",Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
247,"      shadows are blue on the pavements, and the sky is blue with a",Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
248,      deep brightness which is not bright. We come back to have our,Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
249,"      dinner, which lasts one hour. Then the bell rings and we walk in",Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
250,"      a straight column to one of the City Halls, for the Social",Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
251,      Meeting. Other columns of men arrive from the Homes of the,Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
252,"      different Trades. The candles are lit, and the Councils of the",Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
253,"      different Homes stand in a pulpit, and they speak to us of our",Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
254,      duties and of our brother men. Then visiting Leaders mount the,Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
255,      pulpit and they read to us the speeches which were made in the,Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
256,"      City Council that day, for the City Council represents all men",Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
257,"      and all men must know. Then we sing hymns, the Hymn of",Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
258,"      Brotherhood, and the Hymn of Equality, and the Hymn of the",Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
259,      Collective Spirit. The sky is a soggy purple when we return to,Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
260,      the Home. Then the bell rings and we walk in a straight column to,Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
261,      the City Theatre for three hours of Social Recreation. There a,Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
262,"      play is shown upon the stage, with two great choruses from the",Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
263,"      Home of the Actors, which speak and answer all together, in two",Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
264,      great voices. The plays are about toil and how good it is. Then,Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
265,      we walk back to the Home in a straight column. The sky is like a,Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
266,"      black sieve pierced by silver drops that tremble, ready to burst",Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
267,      through. The moths beat against the street lanterns. We go to our,Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
268,"      beds and we sleep, till the bell rings again. The sleeping halls",Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
269,      are white and clean and bare of all things save one hundred beds.,Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
270,"      Thus have we lived each day of four years, until two springs ago",Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
271,      when our crime happened. Thus must all men live until they are,Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
272,"      forty. At forty, they are worn out. At forty, they are sent to",Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
273,"      the Home of the Useless, where the Old Ones live. The Old Ones do",Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
274,"      not work, for the State takes care of them. They sit in the sun",Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
275,      in summer and they sit by the fire in winter. They do not speak,Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
276,"      often, for they are weary. The Old Ones know that they are soon",Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
277,"      to die. When a miracle happens and some live to be forty-five,",Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
278,"      they are the Ancient Ones, and the children stare at them when",Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
279,"      passing by the Home of the Useless. Such is to be our life, as",Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
280,      that of all our brothers and of the brothers who came before us.,Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
281,"      Such would have been our life, had we not committed our crime",Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
282,      which changed all things for us. And it was our curse which drove,Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
283,      us to our crime. We had been a good Street Sweeper and like all,Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
284,"      our brother Street Sweepers, save for our cursed wish to know. We",Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
285,"      looked too long at the stars at night, and at the trees and the",Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
286,"      earth. And when we cleaned the yard of the Home of the Scholars,",Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
287,"      we gathered the glass vials, the pieces of metal, the dried bones",Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
288,      which they had discarded. We wished to keep these things and to,Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
289,"      study them, but we had no place to hide them. So we carried them",Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
290,      to the City Cesspool. And then we made the discovery.,Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
291,      It was on a day of the spring before last. We Street Sweepers,Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
292,"      work in brigades of three, and we were with Union 5-3992, they of",Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
293,"      the half-brain, and with International 4-8818. Now Union 5-3992",Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
294,      are a sickly lad and sometimes they are stricken with,Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
295,"      convulsions, when their mouth froths and their eyes turn white.",Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
296,"      But International 4-8818 are different. They are a tall, strong",Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
297,"      youth and their eyes are like fireflies, for there is laughter in",Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
298,      their eyes. We cannot look upon International 4-8818 and not,Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
299,      smile in answer. For this they were not liked in the Home of the,Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
300,"      Students, as it is not proper to smile without reason. And also",Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
301,      they were not liked because they took pieces of coal and they,Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
302,"      drew pictures upon the walls, and they were pictures which made",Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
303,      men laugh. But it is only our brothers in the Home of the Artists,Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
304,"      who are permitted to draw pictures, so International 4-8818 were",Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
305,"      sent to the Home of the Street Sweepers, like ourselves.",Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
306,      International 4-8818 and we are friends. This is an evil thing to,Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
307,"      say, for it is a transgression, the great Transgression of",Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
308,"      Preference, to love any among men better than the others, since",Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
309,      we must love all men and all men are our friends. So,Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
310,      International 4-8818 and we have never spoken of it. But we know.,Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
311,"      We know, when we look into each others eyes. And when we look",Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
312,"      thus without words, we both know other things also, strange",Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
313,"      things for which there are no words, and these things frighten",Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
314,      us.,Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
315,"      So on that day of the spring before last, Union 5-3992 were",Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
316,"      stricken with convulsions on the edge of the City, near the City",Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
317,      Theatre. We left them to lie in the shade of the Theatre tent and,Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
318,      we went with International 4-8818 to finish our work. We came,Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
319,      together to the great ravine behind the Theatre. It is empty save,Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
320,"      for trees and weeds. Beyond the ravine there is a plain, and",Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
321,"      beyond the plain there lies the Uncharted Forest, about which men",Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
322,      must not think.,Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
323,      We were gathering the papers and the rags which the wind had,Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
324,"      blown from the Theatre, when we saw an iron bar among the weeds.",Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
325,      It was old and rusted by many rains. We pulled with all our,Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
326,"      strength, but we could not move it. So we called International",Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
327,"      4-8818, and together we scraped the earth around the bar. Of a",Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
328,"      sudden the earth fell in before us, and we saw an old iron grill",Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
329,      over a black hole.,Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
330,      International 4-8818 stepped back. But we pulled at the grill and,Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
331,      it gave way. And then we saw iron rings as steps leading down a,Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
332,      shaft into a darkness without bottom.,Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
333,"      We shall go down,ù we said to International 4-8818.",Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
334,"      It is forbidden,ù they answered.",Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
335,"      We said: The Council does not know of this hole, so it cannot be",Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
336,      forbidden.ù,Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
337,"      And they answered: Since the Council does not know of this hole,",Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
338,      there can be no law permitting to enter it. And everything which,Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
339,      is not permitted by law is forbidden.ù,Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
340,"      But we said: We shall go, none the less.ù",Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
341,"      They were frightened, but they stood by and watched us go.",Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
342,      We hung on the iron rings with our hands and our feet. We could,Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
343,      see nothing below us. And above us the hole open upon the sky,Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
344,"      grew smaller and smaller, till it came to be the size of a",Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
345,      button. But still we went down. Then our foot touched the ground.,Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
346,"      We rubbed our eyes, for we could not see. Then our eyes became",Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
347,"      used to the darkness, but we could not believe what we saw.",Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
348,"      No men known to us could have built this place, nor the men known",Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
349,"      to our brothers who lived before us, and yet it was built by men.",Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
350,      It was a great tunnel. Its walls were hard and smooth to the,Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
351,"      touch; it felt like stone, but it was not stone. On the ground",Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
352,"      there were long thin tracks of iron, but it was not iron; it felt",Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
353,"      smooth and cold as glass. We knelt, and we crawled forward, our",Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
354,      hand groping along the iron line to see where it would lead. But,Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
355,      there was an unbroken night ahead. Only the iron tracks glowed,Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
356,"      through it, straight and white, calling us to follow. But we",Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
357,"      could not follow, for we were losing the puddle of light behind",Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
358,"      us. So we turned and we crawled back, our hand on the iron line.",Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
359,"      And our heart beat in our fingertips, without reason. And then we",Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
360,      knew.,Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
361,      We knew suddenly that this place was left from the Unmentionable,Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
362,"      Times. So it was true, and those Times had been, and all the",Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
363,      wonders of those Times. Hundreds upon hundreds of years ago men,Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
364,      knew secrets which we have lost. And we thought: This is a foul,Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
365,      place. They are damned who touch the things of the Unmentionable,Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
366,"      Times.ù But our hand which followed the track, as we crawled,",Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
367,"      clung to the iron as if it would not leave it, as if the skin of",Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
368,      our hand were thirsty and begging of the metal some secret fluid,Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
369,      beating in its coldness.,Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
370,      We returned to the earth. International 4-8818 looked upon us and,Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
371,      stepped back.,Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
372,"      Equality 7-2521,ù they said, your face is white.ù",Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
373,      But we could not speak and we stood looking upon them.,Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
374,"      They backed away, as if they dared not touch us. Then they",Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
375,"      smiled, but it was not a gay smile; it was lost and pleading. But",Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
376,      still we could not speak. Then they said:,Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
377,      We shall report our find to the City Council and both of us will,Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
378,      be rewarded.ù,Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
379,      And then we spoke. Our voice was hard and there was no mercy in,Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
380,      our voice. We said:,Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
381,      We shall not report our find to the City Council. We shall not,Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
382,      report it to any men.ù,Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
383,"      They raised their hands to their ears, for never had they heard",Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
384,      such words as these.,Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
385,"      International 4-8818,ù we asked, will you report us to the",Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
386,      Council and see us lashed to death before your eyes?ù,Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
387,      They stood straight all of a sudden and they answered: Rather,Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
388,      would we die.ù,Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
389,"      Then,ù we said, keep silent. This place is ours. This place",Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
390,"      belongs to us, Equality 7-2521, and to no other men on earth. And",Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
391,"      if ever we surrender it, we shall surrender our life with it",Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
392,      also.ù,Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
393,      Then we saw that the eyes of International 4-8818 were full to,Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
394,"      the lids with tears they dared not drop. They whispered, and",Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
395,"      their voice trembled, so that their words lost all shape:",Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
396,"      The will of the Council is above all things, for it is the will",Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
397,"      of our brothers, which is holy. But if you wish it so, we shall",Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
398,      obey you. Rather shall we be evil with you than good with all our,Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
399,      brothers. May the Council have mercy upon both our hearts!ù,Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
400,      Then we walked away together and back to the Home of the Street,Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
401,      Sweepers. And we walked in silence.,Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
402,"      Thus did it come to pass that each night, when the stars are high",Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
403,"      and the Street Sweepers sit in the City Theatre, we, Equality",Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
404,"      7-2521, steal out and run through the darkness to our place. It",Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
405,      is easy to leave the Theatre; when the candles are blown out and,Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
406,"      the Actors come onto the stage, no eyes can see us as we crawl",Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
407,"      under our seat and under the cloth of the tent. Later, it is easy",Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
408,      to steal through the shadows and fall in line next to,Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
409,"      International 4-8818, as the column leaves the Theatre. It is",Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
410,"      dark in the streets and there are no men about, for no men may",Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
411,      walk through the City when they have no mission to walk there.,Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
412,"      Each night, we run to the ravine, and we remove the stones which",Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
413,      we have piled upon the iron grill to hide it from the men. Each,Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
414,"      night, for three hours, we are under the earth, alone.",Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
415,"      We have stolen candles from the Home of the Street Sweepers, we",Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
416,"      have stolen flints and knives and paper, and we have brought them",Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
417,      to this place. We have stolen glass vials and powders and acids,Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
418,      from the Home of the Scholars. Now we sit in the tunnel for three,Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
419,"      hours each night and we study. We melt strange metals, and we mix",Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
420,"      acids, and we cut open the bodies of the animals which we find in",Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
421,      the City Cesspool. We have built an oven of the bricks we,Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
422,      gathered in the streets. We burn the wood we find in the ravine.,Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
423,      The fire flickers in the oven and blue shadows dance upon the,Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
424,"      walls, and there is no sound of men to disturb us.",Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
425,      We have stolen manuscripts. This is a great offense. Manuscripts,Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
426,"      are precious, for our brothers in the Home of the Clerks spend",Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
427,      one year to copy one single script in their clear handwriting.,Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
428,      Manuscripts are rare and they are kept in the Home of the,Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
429,      Scholars. So we sit under the earth and we read the stolen,Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
430,      scripts. Two years have passed since we found this place. And in,Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
431,      these two years we have learned more than we had learned in the,Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
432,      ten years of the Home of the Students.,Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
433,      We have learned things which are not in the scripts. We have,Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
434,      solved secrets of which the Scholars have no knowledge. We have,Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
435,"      come to see how great is the unexplored, and many lifetimes will",Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
436,      not bring us to the end of our quest. But we wish no end to our,Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
437,"      quest. We wish nothing, save to be alone and to learn, and to",Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
438,      feel as if with each day our sight were growing sharper than the,Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
439,      hawks and clearer than rock crystal.,Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
440,      Strange are the ways of evil. We are false in the faces of our,Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
441,"      brothers. We are defying the will of our Councils. We alone, of",Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
442,"      the thousands who walk this earth, we alone in this hour are",Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
443,      doing a work which has no purpose save that we wish to do it. The,Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
444,      evil of our crime is not for the human mind to probe. The nature,Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
445,"      of our punishment, if it be discovered, is not for the human",Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
446,"      heart to ponder. Never, not in the memory of the Ancient Ones",Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
447,"      Ancients, never have men done that which we are doing.",Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
448,      And yet there is no shame in us and no regret. We say to,Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
449,      ourselves that we are a wretch and a traitor. But we feel no,Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
450,      burden upon our spirit and no fear in our heart. And it seems to,Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
451,      us that our spirit is clear as a lake troubled by no eyes save,Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
452,      those of the sun. And in our heartîstrange are the ways of,Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
453,      evil!îin our heart there is the first peace we have known in,Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
454,      twenty years.,Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
455,      PART TWO,Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
456,      Liberty 5-3000... Liberty five-three thousand ... Liberty,Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
457,      5-3000....,Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
458,"      We wish to write this name. We wish to speak it, but we dare not",Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
459,      speak it above a whisper. For men are forbidden to take notice of,Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
460,"      women, and women are forbidden to take notice of men. But we",Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
461,"      think of one among women, they whose name is Liberty 5-3000, and",Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
462,      we think of no others. The women who have been assigned to work,Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
463,      the soil live in the Homes of the Peasants beyond the City. Where,Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
464,"      the City ends there is a great road winding off to the north, and",Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
465,      we Street Sweepers must keep this road clean to the first,Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
466,"      milepost. There is a hedge along the road, and beyond the hedge",Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
467,"      lie the fields. The fields are black and ploughed, and they lie",Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
468,"      like a great fan before us, with their furrows gathered in some",Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
469,"      hand beyond the sky, spreading forth from that hand, opening wide",Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
470,"      apart as they come toward us, like black pleats that sparkle with",Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
471,"      thin, green spangles. Women work in the fields, and their white",Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
472,      tunics in the wind are like the wings of sea-gulls beating over,Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
473,      the black soil.,Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
474,      And there it was that we saw Liberty 5-3000 walking along the,Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
475,      furrows. Their body was straight and thin as a blade of iron.,Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
476,"      Their eyes were dark and hard and glowing, with no fear in them,",Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
477,      no kindness and no guilt. Their hair was golden as the sun; their,Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
478,"      hair flew in the wind, shining and wild, as if it defied men to",Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
479,      restrain it. They threw seeds from their hand as if they deigned,Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
480,"      to fling a scornful gift, and the earth was a beggar under their",Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
481,      feet.,Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
482,"      We stood still; for the first time did we know fear, and then",Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
483,      pain. And we stood still that we might not spill this pain more,Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
484,      precious than pleasure.,Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
485,      Then we heard a voice from the others call their name: Liberty,Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
486,"      5-3000,ù and they turned and walked back. Thus we learned their",Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
487,"      name, and we stood watching them go, till their white tunic was",Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
488,      lost in the blue mist.,Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
489,"      And the following day, as we came to the northern road, we kept",Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
490,      our eyes upon Liberty 5-3000 in the field. And each day,Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
491,      thereafter we knew the illness of waiting for our hour on the,Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
492,      northern road. And there we looked at Liberty 5-3000 each day. We,Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
493,"      know not whether they looked at us also, but we think they did.",Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
494,"      Then one day they came close to the hedge, and suddenly they",Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
495,      turned to us. They turned in a whirl and the movement of their,Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
496,"      body stopped, as if slashed off, as suddenly as it had started.",Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
497,"      They stood still as a stone, and they looked straight upon us,",Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
498,"      straight into our eyes. There was no smile on their face, and no",Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
499,"      welcome. But their face was taut, and their eyes were dark. Then",Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
500,"      they turned as swiftly, and they walked away from us.",Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
501,"      But the following day, when we came to the road, they smiled.",Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
502,      They smiled to us and for us. And we smiled in answer. Their head,Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
503,"      fell back, and their arms fell, as if their arms and their thin",Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
504,      white neck were stricken suddenly with a great lassitude. They,Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
505,"      were not looking upon us, but upon the sky. Then they glanced at",Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
506,"      us over their shoulder, as we felt as if a hand had touched our",Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
507,"      body, slipping softly from our lips to our feet.",Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
508,"      Every morning thereafter, we greeted each other with our eyes. We",Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
509,      dared not speak. It is a transgression to speak to men of other,Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
510,"      Trades, save in groups at the Social Meetings. But once, standing",Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
511,"      at the hedge, we raised our hand to our forehead and then moved",Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
512,"      it slowly, palm down, toward Liberty 5-3000. Had the others seen",Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
513,"      it, they could have guessed nothing, for it looked only as if we",Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
514,      were shading our eyes from the sun. But Liberty 5-3000 saw it and,Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
515,      understood. They raised their hand to their forehead and moved it,Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
516,"      as we had. Thus, each day, we greet Liberty 5-3000, and they",Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
517,"      answer, and no men can suspect.",Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
518,      We do not wonder at this new sin of ours. It is our second,Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
519,"      Transgression of Preference, for we do not think of all our",Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
520,"      brothers, as we must, but only of one, and their name is Liberty",Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
521,"      5-3000. We do not know why we think of them. We do not know why,",Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
522,"      when we think of them, we feel all of a sudden that the earth is",Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
523,      good and that it is not a burden to live. We do not think of them,Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
524,      as Liberty 5-3000 any longer. We have given them a name in our,Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
525,      thoughts. We call them the Golden One. But it is a sin to give,Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
526,      men names which distinguish them from other men. Yet we call them,Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
527,"      the Golden One, for they are not like the others. The Golden One",Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
528,      are not like the others.,Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
529,      And we take no heed of the law which says that men may not think,Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
530,"      of women, save at the Time of Mating. This is the time each",Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
531,      spring when all the men older than twenty and all the women older,Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
532,      than eighteen are sent for one night to the City Palace of,Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
533,      Mating. And each of the men have one of the women assigned to,Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
534,"      them by the Council of Eugenics. Children are born each winter,",Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
535,      but women never see their children and children never know their,Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
536,"      parents. Twice have we been sent to the Palace of Mating, but it",Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
537,"      is an ugly and shameful matter, of which we do not like to think.",Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
538,"      We had broken so many laws, and today we have broken one more.",Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
539,"      Today, we spoke to the Golden One.",Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
540,"      The other women were far off in the field, when we stopped at the",Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
541,      hedge by the side of the road. The Golden One were kneeling alone,Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
542,      at the moat which runs through the field. And the drops of water,Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
543,"      falling from their hands, as they raised the water to their lips,",Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
544,"      were like sparks of fire in the sun. Then the Golden One saw us,",Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
545,"      and they did not move, kneeling there, looking at us, and circles",Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
546,"      of light played upon their white tunic, from the sun on the water",Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
547,"      of the moat, and one sparkling drop fell from a finger of their",Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
548,      hand held as frozen in the air.,Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
549,"      Then the Golden One rose and walked to the hedge, as if they had",Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
550,      heard a command in our eyes. The two other Street Sweepers of our,Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
551,      brigade were a hundred paces away down the road. And we thought,Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
552,"      that International 4-8818 would not betray us, and Union 5-3992",Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
553,"      would not understand. So we looked straight upon the Golden One,",Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
554,      and we saw the shadows of their lashes on their white cheeks and,Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
555,      the sparks of sun on their lips. And we said:,Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
556,"      You are beautiful, Liberty 5-3000.ù",Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
557,      Their face did not move and they did not avert their eyes. Only,Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
558,"      their eyes grew wider, and there was triumph in their eyes, and",Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
559,"      it was not triumph over us, but over things we could not guess.",Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
560,      Then they asked:,Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
561,      What is your name?ù,Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
562,"      Equality 7-2521,ù we answered.",Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
563,"      You are not one of our brothers, Equality 7-2521, for we do not",Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
564,      wish you to be.ù,Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
565,"      We cannot say what they meant, for there are no words for their",Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
566,"      meaning, but we know it without words and we knew it then.",Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
567,"      No,ù we answered, nor are you one of our sisters.ù",Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
568,"      If you see us among scores of women, will you look upon us?ù",Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
569,"      We shall look upon you, Liberty 5-3000, if we see you among all",Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
570,      the women of the earth.ù,Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
571,      Then they asked:,Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
572,      Are Street Sweepers sent to different parts of the City or do,Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
573,      they always work in the same places?ù,Anthem,"Rand, Ayn"
574,Chapter 1,1984,"Orwell, George"
575,"It was a bright cold day in April, and the clocks were striking thirteen.",1984,"Orwell, George"
576,"Winston Smith, his chin nuzzled into his breast in an effort to escape the",1984,"Orwell, George"
577,"vile wind, slipped quickly through the glass doors of Victory Mansions,",1984,"Orwell, George"
578,though not quickly enough to prevent a swirl of gritty dust from entering,1984,"Orwell, George"
579,along with him.,1984,"Orwell, George"
580,The hallway smelt of boiled cabbage and old rag mats. At one end of it a,1984,"Orwell, George"
581,"coloured poster, too large for indoor display, had been tacked to the wall.",1984,"Orwell, George"
582,"It depicted simply an enormous face, more than a metre wide: the face of a",1984,"Orwell, George"
583,"man of about forty-five, with a heavy black moustache and ruggedly handsome",1984,"Orwell, George"
584,features. Winston made for the stairs. It was no use trying the lift. Even,1984,"Orwell, George"
585,"at the best of times it was seldom working, and at present the electric",1984,"Orwell, George"
586,current was cut off during daylight hours. It was part of the economy drive,1984,"Orwell, George"
587,"in preparation for Hate Week. The flat was seven flights up, and Winston,",1984,"Orwell, George"
588,"who was thirty-nine and had a varicose ulcer above his right ankle, went",1984,"Orwell, George"
589,"slowly, resting several times on the way. On each landing, opposite the",1984,"Orwell, George"
590,"lift-shaft, the poster with the enormous face gazed from the wall. It was",1984,"Orwell, George"
591,one of those pictures which are so contrived that the eyes follow you about,1984,"Orwell, George"
592,"when you move. BIG BROTHER IS WATCHING YOU, the caption beneath it ran.",1984,"Orwell, George"
593,Inside the flat a fruity voice was reading out a list of figures which had,1984,"Orwell, George"
594,something to do with the production of pig-iron. The voice came from an,1984,"Orwell, George"
595,oblong metal plaque like a dulled mirror which formed part of the surface,1984,"Orwell, George"
596,of the right-hand wall. Winston turned a switch and the voice sank,1984,"Orwell, George"
597,"somewhat, though the words were still distinguishable. The instrument",1984,"Orwell, George"
598,"(the telescreen, it was called) could be dimmed, but there was no way of",1984,"Orwell, George"
599,"shutting it off completely. He moved over to the window: a smallish, frail",1984,"Orwell, George"
600,"figure, the meagreness of his body merely emphasized by the blue overalls",1984,"Orwell, George"
601,"which were the uniform of the party. His hair was very fair, his face",1984,"Orwell, George"
602,"naturally sanguine, his skin roughened by coarse soap and blunt razor",1984,"Orwell, George"
603,blades and the cold of the winter that had just ended.,1984,"Orwell, George"
604,"Outside, even through the shut window-pane, the world looked cold. Down in",1984,"Orwell, George"
605,the street little eddies of wind were whirling dust and torn paper into,1984,"Orwell, George"
606,"spirals, and though the sun was shining and the sky a harsh blue, there",1984,"Orwell, George"
607,"seemed to be no colour in anything, except the posters that were plastered",1984,"Orwell, George"
608,"everywhere. The black-moustachiod face gazed down from every commanding
corner. There was one on the house-front immediately opposite. BIG BROTHER
IS WATCHING YOU, the caption said, while the dark eyes looked deep into
Winstons own. Down at street level another poster, torn at one corner,",1984,"Orwell, George"
609,"flapped fitfully in the wind, alternately covering and uncovering the",1984,"Orwell, George"
610,single word INGSOC. In the far distance a helicopter skimmed down between,1984,"Orwell, George"
611,"the roofs, hovered for an instant like a bluebottle, and darted away again",1984,"Orwell, George"
612,"with a curving flight. It was the police patrol, snooping into peoples
windows. The patrols did not matter, however. Only the Thought Police
mattered.

Behind Winstons back the voice from the telescreen was still babbling away",1984,"Orwell, George"
613,about pig-iron and the overfulfilment of the Ninth Three-Year Plan. The,1984,"Orwell, George"
614,telescreen received and transmitted simultaneously. Any sound that Winston,1984,"Orwell, George"
615,"made, above the level of a very low whisper, would be picked up by it,",1984,"Orwell, George"
616,"moreover, so long as he remained within the field of vision which the metal",1984,"Orwell, George"
617,"plaque commanded, he could be seen as well as heard. There was of course",1984,"Orwell, George"
618,no way of knowing whether you were being watched at any given moment. How,1984,"Orwell, George"
619,"often, or on what system, the Thought Police plugged in on any individual",1984,"Orwell, George"
620,wire was guesswork. It was even conceivable that they watched everybody all,1984,"Orwell, George"
621,the time. But at any rate they could plug in your wire whenever they wanted,1984,"Orwell, George"
622,"to. You had to live--did live, from habit that became instinct--in the",1984,"Orwell, George"
623,"assumption that every sound you made was overheard, and, except in",1984,"Orwell, George"
624,"darkness, every movement scrutinized.",1984,"Orwell, George"
625,"Winston kept his back turned to the telescreen. It was safer; though, as he",1984,"Orwell, George"
626,"well knew, even a back can be revealing. A kilometre away the Ministry of",1984,"Orwell, George"
627,"Truth, his place of work, towered vast and white above the grimy landscape.",1984,"Orwell, George"
628,"This, he thought with a sort of vague distaste--this was London, chief",1984,"Orwell, George"
629,"city of Airstrip One, itself the third most populous of the provinces of",1984,"Orwell, George"
630,Oceania. He tried to squeeze out some childhood memory that should tell him,1984,"Orwell, George"
631,whether London had always been quite like this. Were there always these,1984,"Orwell, George"
632,"vistas of rotting nineteenth-century houses, their sides shored up with",1984,"Orwell, George"
633,"baulks of timber, their windows patched with cardboard and their roofs",1984,"Orwell, George"
634,"with corrugated iron, their crazy garden walls sagging in all directions?",1984,"Orwell, George"
635,And the bombed sites where the plaster dust swirled in the air and the,1984,"Orwell, George"
636,willow-herb straggled over the heaps of rubble; and the places where the,1984,"Orwell, George"
637,bombs had cleared a larger patch and there had sprung up sordid colonies,1984,"Orwell, George"
638,"of wooden dwellings like chicken-houses? But it was no use, he could not",1984,"Orwell, George"
639,remember: nothing remained of his childhood except a series of bright-lit,1984,"Orwell, George"
640,tableaux occurring against no background and mostly unintelligible.,1984,"Orwell, George"
641,"The Ministry of Truth--Minitrue, in Newspeak [Newspeak was the official",1984,"Orwell, George"
642,language of Oceania. For an account of its structure and etymology see,1984,"Orwell, George"
643,Appendix.]--was startlingly different from any other object in sight. It,1984,"Orwell, George"
644,"was an enormous pyramidal structure of glittering white concrete, soaring",1984,"Orwell, George"
645,"up, terrace after terrace, 300 metres into the air. From where Winston",1984,"Orwell, George"
646,"stood it was just possible to read, picked out on its white face in",1984,"Orwell, George"
647,"elegant lettering, the three slogans of the Party:",1984,"Orwell, George"
648,  WAR IS PEACE,1984,"Orwell, George"
649,  FREEDOM IS SLAVERY,1984,"Orwell, George"
650,  IGNORANCE IS STRENGTH,1984,"Orwell, George"
651,"The Ministry of Truth contained, it was said, three thousand rooms above",1984,"Orwell, George"
652,"ground level, and corresponding ramifications below. Scattered about London",1984,"Orwell, George"
653,there were just three other buildings of similar appearance and size. So,1984,"Orwell, George"
654,completely did they dwarf the surrounding architecture that from the roof,1984,"Orwell, George"
655,of Victory Mansions you could see all four of them simultaneously. They,1984,"Orwell, George"
656,were the homes of the four Ministries between which the entire apparatus,1984,"Orwell, George"
657,"of government was divided. The Ministry of Truth, which concerned itself",1984,"Orwell, George"
658,"with news, entertainment, education, and the fine arts. The Ministry of",1984,"Orwell, George"
659,"Peace, which concerned itself with war. The Ministry of Love, which",1984,"Orwell, George"
660,"maintained law and order. And the Ministry of Plenty, which was responsible",1984,"Orwell, George"
661,"for economic affairs. Their names, in Newspeak: Minitrue, Minipax, Miniluv,",1984,"Orwell, George"
662,and Miniplenty.,1984,"Orwell, George"
663,The Ministry of Love was the really frightening one. There were no windows,1984,"Orwell, George"
664,"in it at all. Winston had never been inside the Ministry of Love, nor",1984,"Orwell, George"
665,within half a kilometre of it. It was a place impossible to enter except,1984,"Orwell, George"
666,"on official business, and then only by penetrating through a maze of",1984,"Orwell, George"
667,"barbed-wire entanglements, steel doors, and hidden machine-gun nests. Even",1984,"Orwell, George"
668,the streets leading up to its outer barriers were roamed by gorilla-faced,1984,"Orwell, George"
669,"guards in black uniforms, armed with jointed truncheons.",1984,"Orwell, George"
670,Winston turned round abruptly. He had set his features into the,1984,"Orwell, George"
671,expression of quiet optimism which it was advisable to wear when facing,1984,"Orwell, George"
672,the telescreen. He crossed the room into the tiny kitchen. By leaving,1984,"Orwell, George"
673,the Ministry at this time of day he had sacrificed his lunch in the,1984,"Orwell, George"
674,"canteen, and he was aware that there was no food in the kitchen except",1984,"Orwell, George"
675,"a hunk of dark-coloured bread which had got to be saved for tomorrows
breakfast. He took down from the shelf a bottle of colourless liquid
with a plain white label marked VICTORY GIN. It gave off a sickly, oily
smell, as of Chinese rice-spirit. Winston poured out nearly a teacupful,
nerved himself for a shock, and gulped it down like a dose of medicine.

Instantly his face turned scarlet and the water ran out of his eyes. The
stuff was like nitric acid, and moreover, in swallowing it one had the
sensation of being hit on the back of the head with a rubber club. The
next moment, however, the burning in his belly died down and the world
began to look more cheerful. He took a cigarette from a crumpled packet
marked VICTORY CIGARETTES and incautiously held it upright, whereupon the
tobacco fell out on to the floor. With the next he was more successful.
He went back to the living-room and sat down at a small table that stood
to the left of the telescreen. From the table drawer he took out a
penholder, a bottle of ink, and a thick, quarto-sized blank book with a
red back and a marbled cover.

For some reason the telescreen in the living-room was in an unusual
position. Instead of being placed, as was normal, in the end wall, where
it could command the whole room, it was in the longer wall, opposite the
window. To one side of it there was a shallow alcove in which Winston
was now sitting, and which, when the flats were built, had probably been
intended to hold bookshelves. By sitting in the alcove, and keeping well
back, Winston was able to remain outside the range of the telescreen, so
far as sight went. He could be heard, of course, but so long as he stayed
in his present position he could not be seen. It was partly the unusual
geography of the room that had suggested to him the thing that he was now
about to do.

But it had also been suggested by the book that he had just taken out of
the drawer. It was a peculiarly beautiful book. Its smooth creamy paper,
a little yellowed by age, was of a kind that had not been manufactured for
at least forty years past. He could guess, however, that the book was much
older than that. He had seen it lying in the window of a frowsy little
junk-shop in a slummy quarter of the town (just what quarter he did not
now remember) and had been stricken immediately by an overwhelming desire
to possess it. Party members were supposed not to go into ordinary shops
(dealing on the free market, it was called), but the rule was not
strictly kept, because there were various things, such as shoelaces and
razor blades, which it was impossible to get hold of in any other way. He
had given a quick glance up and down the street and then had slipped inside
and bought the book for two dollars fifty. At the time he was not conscious
of wanting it for any particular purpose. He had carried it guiltily home
in his briefcase. Even with nothing written in it, it was a compromising
possession.

The thing that he was about to do was to open a diary. This was not illegal
(nothing was illegal, since there were no longer any laws), but if detected
it was reasonably certain that it would be punished by death, or at least
by twenty-five years in a forced-labour camp. Winston fitted a nib into
the penholder and sucked it to get the grease off. The pen was an archaic
instrument, seldom used even for signatures, and he had procured one,
furtively and with some difficulty, simply because of a feeling that the
beautiful creamy paper deserved to be written on with a real nib instead
of being scratched with an ink-pencil. Actually he was not used to writing
by hand. Apart from very short notes, it was usual to dictate everything
into the speak-write which was of course impossible for his present
purpose. He dipped the pen into the ink and then faltered for just a
second. A tremor had gone through his bowels. To mark the paper was the
decisive act. In small clumsy letters he wrote:


   April 4th, 1984.


He sat back. A sense of complete helplessness had descended upon him. To
begin with, he did not know with any certainty that this was 1984. It
must be round about that date, since he was fairly sure that his age was
thirty-nine, and he believed that he had been born in 1944 or 1945; but
it was never possible nowadays to pin down any date within a year or two.

For whom, it suddenly occurred to him to wonder, was he writing this diary?
For the future, for the unborn. His mind hovered for a moment round the
doubtful date on the page, and then fetched up with a bump against the
Newspeak word DOUBLETHINK. For the first time the magnitude of what he had
undertaken came home to him. How could you communicate with the future? It
was of its nature impossible. Either the future would resemble the present,
in which case it would not listen to him: or it would be different from it,
and his predicament would be meaningless.

For some time he sat gazing stupidly at the paper. The telescreen had
changed over to strident military music. It was curious that he seemed
not merely to have lost the power of expressing himself, but even to have
forgotten what it was that he had originally intended to say. For weeks
past he had been making ready for this moment, and it had never crossed
his mind that anything would be needed except courage. The actual writing
would be easy. All he had to do was to transfer to paper the interminable
restless monologue that had been running inside his head, literally for
years. At this moment, however, even the monologue had dried up. Moreover
his varicose ulcer had begun itching unbearably. He dared not scratch it,
because if he did so it always became inflamed. The seconds were ticking
by. He was conscious of nothing except the blankness of the page in front
of him, the itching of the skin above his ankle, the blaring of the music,
and a slight booziness caused by the gin.

Suddenly he began writing in sheer panic, only imperfectly aware of what
he was setting down. His small but childish handwriting straggled up and
down the page, shedding first its capital letters and finally even its
full stops:


   April 4th, 1984. Last night to the flicks. All war films. One very good
one of a ship full of refugees being bombed somewhere in the Mediterranean.
Audience much amused by shots of a great huge fat man trying to swim away
with a helicopter after him, first you saw him wallowing along in the
water like a porpoise, then you saw him through the helicopters gunsights,
then he was full of holes and the sea round him turned pink and he sank as
suddenly as though the holes had let in the water, audience shouting with
laughter when he sank. then you saw a lifeboat full of children with a
helicopter hovering over it. there was a middle-aged woman might have been
a jewess sitting up in the bow with a little boy about three years old in
her arms. little boy screaming with fright and hiding his head between her
breasts as if he was trying to burrow right into her and the woman putting
her arms round him and comforting him although she was blue with fright
herself, all the time covering him up as much as possible as if she thought
her arms could keep the bullets off him. then the helicopter planted a 20
kilo bomb in among them terrific flash and the boat went all to matchwood.
then there was a wonderful shot of a childs arm going up up up right up",1984,"Orwell, George"
676,into the air a helicopter with a camera in its nose must have followed it,1984,"Orwell, George"
677,up and there was a lot of applause from the party seats but a woman down in,1984,"Orwell, George"
678,the prole part of the house suddenly started kicking up a fuss and shouting,1984,"Orwell, George"
679,they didnt oughter of showed it not in front of kids they didnt it aint,1984,"Orwell, George"
680,right not in front of kids it aint until the police turned her turned her,1984,"Orwell, George"
681,out i dont suppose anything happened to her nobody cares what the proles,1984,"Orwell, George"
682,say typical prole reaction they never----,1984,"Orwell, George"
683,"Winston stopped writing, partly because he was suffering from cramp. He did",1984,"Orwell, George"
684,not know what had made him pour out this stream of rubbish. But the curious,1984,"Orwell, George"
685,thing was that while he was doing so a totally different memory had,1984,"Orwell, George"
686,"clarified itself in his mind, to the point where he almost felt equal to",1984,"Orwell, George"
687,"writing it down. It was, he now realized, because of this other incident",1984,"Orwell, George"
688,that he had suddenly decided to come home and begin the diary today.,1984,"Orwell, George"
689,"It had happened that morning at the Ministry, if anything so nebulous could",1984,"Orwell, George"
690,be said to happen.,1984,"Orwell, George"
691,"It was nearly eleven hundred, and in the Records Department, where Winston",1984,"Orwell, George"
692,"worked, they were dragging the chairs out of the cubicles and grouping them",1984,"Orwell, George"
693,"in the centre of the hall opposite the big telescreen, in preparation for",1984,"Orwell, George"
694,the Two Minutes Hate. Winston was just taking his place in one of the,1984,"Orwell, George"
695,"middle rows when two people whom he knew by sight, but had never spoken",1984,"Orwell, George"
696,"to, came unexpectedly into the room. One of them was a girl whom he often",1984,"Orwell, George"
697,"passed in the corridors. He did not know her name, but he knew that she",1984,"Orwell, George"
698,worked in the Fiction Department. Presumably--since he had sometimes seen,1984,"Orwell, George"
699,her with oily hands and carrying a spanner--she had some mechanical job,1984,"Orwell, George"
700,"on one of the novel-writing machines. She was a bold-looking girl, of",1984,"Orwell, George"
701,"about twenty-seven, with thick hair, a freckled face, and swift, athletic",1984,"Orwell, George"
702,"movements. A narrow scarlet sash, emblem of the Junior Anti-Sex League, was",1984,"Orwell, George"
703,"wound several times round the waist of her overalls, just tightly enough to",1984,"Orwell, George"
704,bring out the shapeliness of her hips. Winston had disliked her from the,1984,"Orwell, George"
705,very first moment of seeing her. He knew the reason. It was because of the,1984,"Orwell, George"
706,atmosphere of hockey-fields and cold baths and community hikes and general,1984,"Orwell, George"
707,clean-mindedness which she managed to carry about with her. He disliked,1984,"Orwell, George"
708,"nearly all women, and especially the young and pretty ones. It was always",1984,"Orwell, George"
709,"the women, and above all the young ones, who were the most bigoted",1984,"Orwell, George"
710,"adherents of the Party, the swallowers of slogans, the amateur spies and",1984,"Orwell, George"
711,nosers-out of unorthodoxy. But this particular girl gave him the impression,1984,"Orwell, George"
712,of being more dangerous than most. Once when they passed in the corridor,1984,"Orwell, George"
713,she gave him a quick sidelong glance which seemed to pierce right into,1984,"Orwell, George"
714,him and for a moment had filled him with black terror. The idea had even,1984,"Orwell, George"
715,"crossed his mind that she might be an agent of the Thought Police. That,",1984,"Orwell, George"
716,"it was true, was very unlikely. Still, he continued to feel a peculiar",1984,"Orwell, George"
717,"uneasiness, which had fear mixed up in it as well as hostility, whenever",1984,"Orwell, George"
718,she was anywhere near him.,1984,"Orwell, George"
719,"The other person was a man named OBrien, a member of the Inner Party and
holder of some post so important and remote that Winston had only a dim
idea of its nature. A momentary hush passed over the group of people
round the chairs as they saw the black overalls of an Inner Party member
approaching. OBrien was a large, burly man with a thick neck and a coarse,",1984,"Orwell, George"
720,"humorous, brutal face. In spite of his formidable appearance he had a",1984,"Orwell, George"
721,certain charm of manner. He had a trick of resettling his spectacles on,1984,"Orwell, George"
722,"his nose which was curiously disarming--in some indefinable way, curiously",1984,"Orwell, George"
723,"civilized. It was a gesture which, if anyone had still thought in such",1984,"Orwell, George"
724,"terms, might have recalled an eighteenth-century nobleman offering his",1984,"Orwell, George"
725,"snuffbox. Winston had seen OBrien perhaps a dozen times in almost as many
years. He felt deeply drawn to him, and not solely because he was intrigued
by the contrast between OBriens urbane manner and his prize-fighters",1984,"Orwell, George"
726,physique. Much more it was because of a secretly held belief--or perhaps,1984,"Orwell, George"
727,"not even a belief, merely a hope--that OBriens political orthodoxy was",1984,"Orwell, George"
728,"not perfect. Something in his face suggested it irresistibly. And again,",1984,"Orwell, George"
729,"perhaps it was not even unorthodoxy that was written in his face, but",1984,"Orwell, George"
730,simply intelligence. But at any rate he had the appearance of being a,1984,"Orwell, George"
731,person that you could talk to if somehow you could cheat the telescreen and,1984,"Orwell, George"
732,get him alone. Winston had never made the smallest effort to verify this,1984,"Orwell, George"
733,"guess: indeed, there was no way of doing so. At this moment OBrien glanced
at his wrist-watch, saw that it was nearly eleven hundred, and evidently
decided to stay in the Records Department until the Two Minutes Hate was
over. He took a chair in the same row as Winston, a couple of places away.
A small, sandy-haired woman who worked in the next cubicle to Winston was
between them. The girl with dark hair was sitting immediately behind.

The next moment a hideous, grinding speech, as of some monstrous machine
running without oil, burst from the big telescreen at the end of the room.
It was a noise that set ones teeth on edge and bristled the hair at the",1984,"Orwell, George"
734,"back of ones neck. The Hate had started.

As usual, the face of Emmanuel Goldstein, the Enemy of the People, had
flashed on to the screen. There were hisses here and there among the
audience. The little sandy-haired woman gave a squeak of mingled fear and
disgust. Goldstein was the renegade and backslider who once, long ago
(how long ago, nobody quite remembered), had been one of the leading
figures of the Party, almost on a level with Big Brother himself, and
then had engaged in counter-revolutionary activities, had been condemned
to death, and had mysteriously escaped and disappeared. The programmes
of the Two Minutes Hate varied from day to day, but there was none in
which Goldstein was not the principal figure. He was the primal traitor,
the earliest defiler of the Partys purity. All subsequent crimes against",1984,"Orwell, George"
735,"the Party, all treacheries, acts of sabotage, heresies, deviations,",1984,"Orwell, George"
736,sprang directly out of his teaching. Somewhere or other he was still,1984,"Orwell, George"
737,"alive and hatching his conspiracies: perhaps somewhere beyond the sea,",1984,"Orwell, George"
738,"under the protection of his foreign paymasters, perhaps even--so it was",1984,"Orwell, George"
739,occasionally rumoured--in some hiding-place in Oceania itself.,1984,"Orwell, George"
740,"Winstons diaphragm was constricted. He could never see the face of
Goldstein without a painful mixture of emotions. It was a lean Jewish face,
with a great fuzzy aureole of white hair and a small goatee beard--a
clever face, and yet somehow inherently despicable, with a kind of senile
silliness in the long thin nose, near the end of which a pair of spectacles
was perched. It resembled the face of a sheep, and the voice, too, had a
sheep-like quality. Goldstein was delivering his usual venomous attack
upon the doctrines of the Party--an attack so exaggerated and perverse that
a child should have been able to see through it, and yet just plausible
enough to fill one with an alarmed feeling that other people, less
level-headed than oneself, might be taken in by it. He was abusing Big
Brother, he was denouncing the dictatorship of the Party, he was demanding
the immediate conclusion of peace with Eurasia, he was advocating freedom
of speech, freedom of the Press, freedom of assembly, freedom of thought,
he was crying hysterically that the revolution had been betrayed--and all
this in rapid polysyllabic speech which was a sort of parody of the
habitual style of the orators of the Party, and even contained Newspeak
words: more Newspeak words, indeed, than any Party member would normally
use in real life. And all the while, lest one should be in any doubt as to
the reality which Goldsteins specious claptrap covered, behind his head on",1984,"Orwell, George"
741,the telescreen there marched the endless columns of the Eurasian army--row,1984,"Orwell, George"
742,"after row of solid-looking men with expressionless Asiatic faces, who swam",1984,"Orwell, George"
743,"up to the surface of the screen and vanished, to be replaced by others",1984,"Orwell, George"
744,"exactly similar. The dull rhythmic tramp of the soldiers boots formed the
background to Goldsteins bleating voice.",1984,"Orwell, George"
745,"Before the Hate had proceeded for thirty seconds, uncontrollable",1984,"Orwell, George"
746,exclamations of rage were breaking out from half the people in the room.,1984,"Orwell, George"
747,"The self-satisfied sheep-like face on the screen, and the terrifying power",1984,"Orwell, George"
748,"of the Eurasian army behind it, were too much to be borne: besides,",1984,"Orwell, George"
749,the sight or even the thought of Goldstein produced fear and anger,1984,"Orwell, George"
750,automatically. He was an object of hatred more constant than either Eurasia,1984,"Orwell, George"
751,"or Eastasia, since when Oceania was at war with one of these Powers it was",1984,"Orwell, George"
752,generally at peace with the other. But what was strange was that although,1984,"Orwell, George"
753,"Goldstein was hated and despised by everybody, although every day and a",1984,"Orwell, George"
754,"thousand times a day, on platforms, on the telescreen, in newspapers,",1984,"Orwell, George"
755,"in books, his theories were refuted, smashed, ridiculed, held up to the",1984,"Orwell, George"
756,"general gaze for the pitiful rubbish that they were--in spite of all this,",1984,"Orwell, George"
757,his influence never seemed to grow less. Always there were fresh dupes,1984,"Orwell, George"
758,waiting to be seduced by him. A day never passed when spies and saboteurs,1984,"Orwell, George"
759,acting under his directions were not unmasked by the Thought Police.,1984,"Orwell, George"
760,"He was the commander of a vast shadowy army, an underground network of",1984,"Orwell, George"
761,"conspirators dedicated to the overthrow of the State. The Brotherhood, its",1984,"Orwell, George"
762,name was supposed to be. There were also whispered stories of a terrible,1984,"Orwell, George"
763,"book, a compendium of all the heresies, of which Goldstein was the author",1984,"Orwell, George"
764,and which circulated clandestinely here and there. It was a book without a,1984,"Orwell, George"
765,"title. People referred to it, if at all, simply as THE BOOK. But one knew",1984,"Orwell, George"
766,of such things only through vague rumours. Neither the Brotherhood nor,1984,"Orwell, George"
767,THE BOOK was a subject that any ordinary Party member would mention if,1984,"Orwell, George"
768,there was a way of avoiding it.,1984,"Orwell, George"
769,In its second minute the Hate rose to a frenzy. People were leaping up and,1984,"Orwell, George"
770,down in their places and shouting at the tops of their voices in an effort,1984,"Orwell, George"
771,to drown the maddening bleating voice that came from the screen. The little,1984,"Orwell, George"
772,"sandy-haired woman had turned bright pink, and her mouth was opening and",1984,"Orwell, George"
773,shutting like that of a landed fish. Even OBriens heavy face was flushed.,1984,"Orwell, George"
774,"He was sitting very straight in his chair, his powerful chest swelling and",1984,"Orwell, George"
775,quivering as though he were standing up to the assault of a wave. The,1984,"Orwell, George"
776,dark-haired girl behind Winston had begun crying out Swine! Swine! Swine!,1984,"Orwell, George"
777,and suddenly she picked up a heavy Newspeak dictionary and flung it at the,1984,"Orwell, George"
778,"screen. It struck Goldsteins nose and bounced off; the voice continued
inexorably. In a lucid moment Winston found that he was shouting with the
others and kicking his heel violently against the rung of his chair. The
horrible thing about the Two Minutes Hate was not that one was obliged to
act a part, but, on the contrary, that it was impossible to avoid joining
in. Within thirty seconds any pretence was always unnecessary. A hideous
ecstasy of fear and vindictiveness, a desire to kill, to torture, to smash
faces in with a sledge-hammer, seemed to flow through the whole group of
people like an electric current, turning one even against ones will into",1984,"Orwell, George"
779,"a grimacing, screaming lunatic. And yet the rage that one felt was an",1984,"Orwell, George"
780,"abstract, undirected emotion which could be switched from one object to",1984,"Orwell, George"
781,"another like the flame of a blowlamp. Thus, at one moment Winstons hatred
was not turned against Goldstein at all, but, on the contrary, against
Big Brother, the Party, and the Thought Police; and at such moments his
heart went out to the lonely, derided heretic on the screen, sole guardian
of truth and sanity in a world of lies. And yet the very next instant he
was at one with the people about him, and all that was said of Goldstein
seemed to him to be true. At those moments his secret loathing of Big
Brother changed into adoration, and Big Brother seemed to tower up, an
invincible, fearless protector, standing like a rock against the hordes
of Asia, and Goldstein, in spite of his isolation, his helplessness, and
the doubt that hung about his very existence, seemed like some sinister
enchanter, capable by the mere power of his voice of wrecking the structure
of civilization.

It was even possible, at moments, to switch ones hatred this way or that",1984,"Orwell, George"
782,"by a voluntary act. Suddenly, by the sort of violent effort with which one",1984,"Orwell, George"
783,"wrenches ones head away from the pillow in a nightmare, Winston succeeded
in transferring his hatred from the face on the screen to the dark-haired
girl behind him. Vivid, beautiful hallucinations flashed through his mind.
He would flog her to death with a rubber truncheon. He would tie her naked
to a stake and shoot her full of arrows like Saint Sebastian. He would
ravish her and cut her throat at the moment of climax. Better than before,
moreover, he realized WHY it was that he hated her. He hated her because
she was young and pretty and sexless, because he wanted to go to bed with
her and would never do so, because round her sweet supple waist, which
seemed to ask you to encircle it with your arm, there was only the odious
scarlet sash, aggressive symbol of chastity.

The Hate rose to its climax. The voice of Goldstein had become an actual
sheeps bleat, and for an instant the face changed into that of a sheep.",1984,"Orwell, George"
784,Then the sheep-face melted into the figure of a Eurasian soldier who seemed,1984,"Orwell, George"
785,"to be advancing, huge and terrible, his sub-machine gun roaring, and",1984,"Orwell, George"
786,"seeming to spring out of the surface of the screen, so that some of the",1984,"Orwell, George"
787,people in the front row actually flinched backwards in their seats. But,1984,"Orwell, George"
788,"in the same moment, drawing a deep sigh of relief from everybody, the",1984,"Orwell, George"
789,"hostile figure melted into the face of Big Brother, black-haired,",1984,"Orwell, George"
790,"black-moustachiod, full of power and mysterious calm, and so vast that
it almost filled up the screen. Nobody heard what Big Brother was saying.
It was merely a few words of encouragement, the sort of words that are
uttered in the din of battle, not distinguishable individually but
restoring confidence by the fact of being spoken. Then the face of Big
Brother faded away again, and instead the three slogans of the Party stood
out in bold capitals:


  WAR IS PEACE
  FREEDOM IS SLAVERY
  IGNORANCE IS STRENGTH


But the face of Big Brother seemed to persist for several seconds on the
screen, as though the impact that it had made on everyones eyeballs was",1984,"Orwell, George"
791,too vivid to wear off immediately. The little sandy-haired woman had flung,1984,"Orwell, George"
792,herself forward over the back of the chair in front of her. With a,1984,"Orwell, George"
793,tremulous murmur that sounded like My Saviour! she extended her arms,1984,"Orwell, George"
794,towards the screen. Then she buried her face in her hands. It was apparent,1984,"Orwell, George"
795,that she was uttering a prayer.,1984,"Orwell, George"
796,"At this moment the entire group of people broke into a deep, slow,",1984,"Orwell, George"
797,"rhythmical chant of B-B!...B-B!--over and over again, very slowly, with a",1984,"Orwell, George"
798,"long pause between the first B and the second--a heavy, murmurous sound,",1984,"Orwell, George"
799,"somehow curiously savage, in the background of which one seemed to hear the",1984,"Orwell, George"
800,stamp of naked feet and the throbbing of tom-toms. For perhaps as much as,1984,"Orwell, George"
801,thirty seconds they kept it up. It was a refrain that was often heard in,1984,"Orwell, George"
802,moments of overwhelming emotion. Partly it was a sort of hymn to the wisdom,1984,"Orwell, George"
803,"and majesty of Big Brother, but still more it was an act of self-hypnosis,",1984,"Orwell, George"
804,a deliberate drowning of consciousness by means of rhythmic noise.,1984,"Orwell, George"
805,"Winstons entrails seemed to grow cold. In the Two Minutes Hate he could
not help sharing in the general delirium, but this sub-human chanting of
B-B!...B-B! always filled him with horror. Of course he chanted with the
rest: it was impossible to do otherwise. To dissemble your feelings, to
control your face, to do what everyone else was doing, was an instinctive
reaction. But there was a space of a couple of seconds during which the
expression of his eyes might conceivably have betrayed him. And it was
exactly at this moment that the significant thing happened--if, indeed,
it did happen.

Momentarily he caught OBriens eye. OBrien had stood up. He had taken",1984,"Orwell, George"
806,off his spectacles and was in the act of resettling them on his nose with,1984,"Orwell, George"
807,his characteristic gesture. But there was a fraction of a second when,1984,"Orwell, George"
808,"their eyes met, and for as long as it took to happen Winston knew--yes, he",1984,"Orwell, George"
809,"KNEW!--that OBrien was thinking the same thing as himself. An unmistakable
message had passed. It was as though their two minds had opened and the
thoughts were flowing from one into the other through their eyes. I am",1984,"Orwell, George"
810,"with you, OBrien seemed to be saying to him. I know precisely what you
are feeling. I know all about your contempt, your hatred, your disgust.
But dont worry, I am on your side! And then the flash of intelligence
was gone, and OBriens face was as inscrutable as everybody elses.",1984,"Orwell, George"
811,"That was all, and he was already uncertain whether it had happened. Such",1984,"Orwell, George"
812,incidents never had any sequel. All that they did was to keep alive in him,1984,"Orwell, George"
813,"the belief, or hope, that others besides himself were the enemies of the",1984,"Orwell, George"
814,Party. Perhaps the rumours of vast underground conspiracies were true after,1984,"Orwell, George"
815,"all--perhaps the Brotherhood really existed! It was impossible, in spite",1984,"Orwell, George"
816,"of the endless arrests and confessions and executions, to be sure that the",1984,"Orwell, George"
817,"Brotherhood was not simply a myth. Some days he believed in it, some days",1984,"Orwell, George"
818,"not. There was no evidence, only fleeting glimpses that might mean anything",1984,"Orwell, George"
819,"or nothing: snatches of overheard conversation, faint scribbles on lavatory",1984,"Orwell, George"
820,"walls--once, even, when two strangers met, a small movement of the hand",1984,"Orwell, George"
821,which had looked as though it might be a signal of recognition. It was all,1984,"Orwell, George"
822,guesswork: very likely he had imagined everything. He had gone back to his,1984,"Orwell, George"
823,"cubicle without looking at OBrien again. The idea of following up their
momentary contact hardly crossed his mind. It would have been inconceivably
dangerous even if he had known how to set about doing it. For a second, two
seconds, they had exchanged an equivocal glance, and that was the end of
the story. But even that was a memorable event, in the locked loneliness in
which one had to live.

Winston roused himself and sat up straighter. He let out a belch. The gin
was rising from his stomach.

His eyes re-focused on the page. He discovered that while he sat helplessly
musing he had also been writing, as though by automatic action. And it was
no longer the same cramped, awkward handwriting as before. His pen had slid
voluptuously over the smooth paper, printing in large neat capitals--


  DOWN WITH BIG BROTHER
  DOWN WITH BIG BROTHER
  DOWN WITH BIG BROTHER
  DOWN WITH BIG BROTHER
  DOWN WITH BIG BROTHER


over and over again, filling half a page.

He could not help feeling a twinge of panic. It was absurd, since the
writing of those particular words was not more dangerous than the initial
act of opening the diary, but for a moment he was tempted to tear out the
spoiled pages and abandon the enterprise altogether.

He did not do so, however, because he knew that it was useless. Whether he
wrote DOWN WITH BIG BROTHER, or whether he refrained from writing it, made
no difference. Whether he went on with the diary, or whether he did not go
on with it, made no difference. The Thought Police would get him just the
same. He had committed--would still have committed, even if he had never
set pen to paper--the essential crime that contained all others in itself.
Thoughtcrime, they called it. Thoughtcrime was not a thing that could be
concealed for ever. You might dodge successfully for a while, even for
years, but sooner or later they were bound to get you.

It was always at night--the arrests invariably happened at night. The
sudden jerk out of sleep, the rough hand shaking your shoulder, the lights
glaring in your eyes, the ring of hard faces round the bed. In the vast
majority of cases there was no trial, no report of the arrest. People
simply disappeared, always during the night. Your name was removed from the
registers, every record of everything you had ever done was wiped out, your
one-time existence was denied and then forgotten. You were abolished,
annihilated: VAPORIZED was the usual word.

For a moment he was seized by a kind of hysteria. He began writing in a
hurried untidy scrawl:


   theyll shoot me i dont care theyll shoot me in the back of the neck i",1984,"Orwell, George"
824,dont care down with big brother they always shoot you in the back of the,1984,"Orwell, George"
825,neck i dont care down with big brother----,1984,"Orwell, George"
826,"He sat back in his chair, slightly ashamed of himself, and laid down",1984,"Orwell, George"
827,the pen. The next moment he started violently. There was a knocking at,1984,"Orwell, George"
828,the door.,1984,"Orwell, George"
829,"Already! He sat as still as a mouse, in the futile hope that whoever it was",1984,"Orwell, George"
830,"might go away after a single attempt. But no, the knocking was repeated.",1984,"Orwell, George"
831,The worst thing of all would be to delay. His heart was thumping like a,1984,"Orwell, George"
832,"drum, but his face, from long habit, was probably expressionless. He got",1984,"Orwell, George"
833,up and moved heavily towards the door.,1984,"Orwell, George"
834,Chapter 2,1984,"Orwell, George"
835,As he put his hand to the door-knob Winston saw that he had left the,1984,"Orwell, George"
836,"diary open on the table. DOWN WITH BIG BROTHER was written all over it,",1984,"Orwell, George"
837,in letters almost big enough to be legible across the room. It was an,1984,"Orwell, George"
838,"inconceivably stupid thing to have done. But, he realized, even in his",1984,"Orwell, George"
839,panic he had not wanted to smudge the creamy paper by shutting the book,1984,"Orwell, George"
840,while the ink was wet.,1984,"Orwell, George"
841,He drew in his breath and opened the door. Instantly a warm wave of relief,1984,"Orwell, George"
842,"flowed through him. A colourless, crushed-looking woman, with wispy hair",1984,"Orwell, George"
843,"and a lined face, was standing outside.",1984,"Orwell, George"
844,"Oh, comrade, she began in a dreary, whining sort of voice, I thought I
heard you come in. Do you think you could come across and have a look at
our kitchen sink? Its got blocked up and----

It was Mrs Parsons, the wife of a neighbour on the same floor. (Mrs was
a word somewhat discountenanced by the Party--you were supposed to call
everyone comrade--but with some women one used it instinctively.) She was
a woman of about thirty, but looking much older. One had the impression
that there was dust in the creases of her face. Winston followed her down
the passage. These amateur repair jobs were an almost daily irritation.
Victory Mansions were old flats, built in 1930 or thereabouts, and were
falling to pieces. The plaster flaked constantly from ceilings and walls,
the pipes burst in every hard frost, the roof leaked whenever there was
snow, the heating system was usually running at half steam when it was not
closed down altogether from motives of economy. Repairs, except what you
could do for yourself, had to be sanctioned by remote committees which
were liable to hold up even the mending of a window-pane for two years.

Of course its only because Tom isnt home, said Mrs Parsons vaguely.

The Parsons flat was bigger than Winstons, and dingy in a different
way. Everything had a battered, trampled-on look, as though the
place had just been visited by some large violent animal. Games
impedimenta--hockey-sticks, boxing-gloves, a burst football, a pair of
sweaty shorts turned inside out--lay all over the floor, and on the
table there was a litter of dirty dishes and dog-eared exercise-books.
On the walls were scarlet banners of the Youth League and the Spies, and
a full-sized poster of Big Brother. There was the usual boiled-cabbage
smell, common to the whole building, but it was shot through by a sharper
reek of sweat, which--one knew this at the first sniff, though it was
hard to say how--was the sweat of some person not present at the moment.
In another room someone with a comb and a piece of toilet paper was
trying to keep tune with the military music which was still issuing
from the telescreen.

Its the children, said Mrs Parsons, casting a half-apprehensive glance",1984,"Orwell, George"
845,"at the door. They havent been out today. And of course----

She had a habit of breaking off her sentences in the middle. The kitchen
sink was full nearly to the brim with filthy greenish water which smelt
worse than ever of cabbage. Winston knelt down and examined the angle-joint
of the pipe. He hated using his hands, and he hated bending down, which was
always liable to start him coughing. Mrs Parsons looked on helplessly.

Of course if Tom was home hed put it right in a moment, she said.",1984,"Orwell, George"
846,"He loves anything like that. Hes ever so good with his hands, Tom is.

Parsons was Winstons fellow-employee at the Ministry of Truth. He was",1984,"Orwell, George"
847,"a fattish but active man of paralysing stupidity, a mass of imbecile",1984,"Orwell, George"
848,"enthusiasms--one of those completely unquestioning, devoted drudges on",1984,"Orwell, George"
849,"whom, more even than on the Thought Police, the stability of the Party",1984,"Orwell, George"
850,depended. At thirty-five he had just been unwillingly evicted from the,1984,"Orwell, George"
851,"Youth League, and before graduating into the Youth League he had managed to",1984,"Orwell, George"
852,stay on in the Spies for a year beyond the statutory age. At the Ministry,1984,"Orwell, George"
853,he was employed in some subordinate post for which intelligence was not,1984,"Orwell, George"
854,"required, but on the other hand he was a leading figure on the Sports",1984,"Orwell, George"
855,Committee and all the other committees engaged in organizing community,1984,"Orwell, George"
856,"hikes, spontaneous demonstrations, savings campaigns, and voluntary",1984,"Orwell, George"
857,"activities generally. He would inform you with quiet pride, between whiffs",1984,"Orwell, George"
858,"of his pipe, that he had put in an appearance at the Community Centre every",1984,"Orwell, George"
859,"evening for the past four years. An overpowering smell of sweat, a sort of",1984,"Orwell, George"
860,"unconscious testimony to the strenuousness of his life, followed him about",1984,"Orwell, George"
861,"wherever he went, and even remained behind him after he had gone.",1984,"Orwell, George"
862,"Have you got a spanner? said Winston, fiddling with the nut on the",1984,"Orwell, George"
863,angle-joint.,1984,"Orwell, George"
864,"A spanner, said Mrs Parsons, immediately becoming invertebrate. I dont",1984,"Orwell, George"
865,"know, Im sure. Perhaps the children----",1984,"Orwell, George"
866,There was a trampling of boots and another blast on the comb as the,1984,"Orwell, George"
867,children charged into the living-room. Mrs Parsons brought the spanner.,1984,"Orwell, George"
868,Winston let out the water and disgustedly removed the clot of human hair,1984,"Orwell, George"
869,that had blocked up the pipe. He cleaned his fingers as best he could in,1984,"Orwell, George"
870,the cold water from the tap and went back into the other room.,1984,"Orwell, George"
871,Up with your hands! yelled a savage voice.,1984,"Orwell, George"
872,"A handsome, tough-looking boy of nine had popped up from behind the table",1984,"Orwell, George"
873,"and was menacing him with a toy automatic pistol, while his small sister,",1984,"Orwell, George"
874,"about two years younger, made the same gesture with a fragment of wood.",1984,"Orwell, George"
875,"Both of them were dressed in the blue shorts, grey shirts, and red",1984,"Orwell, George"
876,neckerchiefs which were the uniform of the Spies. Winston raised his hands,1984,"Orwell, George"
877,"above his head, but with an uneasy feeling, so vicious was the boys
demeanour, that it was not altogether a game.

Youre a traitor! yelled the boy. Youre a thought-criminal! Youre a
Eurasian spy! Ill shoot you, Ill vaporize you, Ill send you to the salt",1984,"Orwell, George"
878,"mines!

Suddenly they were both leaping round him, shouting Traitor! and
Thought-criminal! the little girl imitating her brother in every
movement. It was somehow slightly frightening, like the gambolling of
tiger cubs which will soon grow up into man-eaters. There was a sort of
calculating ferocity in the boys eye, a quite evident desire to hit or",1984,"Orwell, George"
879,kick Winston and a consciousness of being very nearly big enough to do so.,1984,"Orwell, George"
880,"It was a good job it was not a real pistol he was holding, Winston thought.",1984,"Orwell, George"
881,"Mrs Parsons eyes flitted nervously from Winston to the children, and back
again. In the better light of the living-room he noticed with interest
that there actually was dust in the creases of her face.

They do get so noisy, she said. Theyre disappointed because they
couldnt go to see the hanging, thats what it is. Im too busy to take",1984,"Orwell, George"
882,them. and Tom wont be back from work in time.,1984,"Orwell, George"
883,"Why cant we go and see the hanging? roared the boy in his huge voice.

Want to see the hanging! Want to see the hanging! chanted the little
girl, still capering round.

Some Eurasian prisoners, guilty of war crimes, were to be hanged in the
Park that evening, Winston remembered. This happened about once a month,
and was a popular spectacle. Children always clamoured to be taken to see
it. He took his leave of Mrs Parsons and made for the door. But he had not
gone six steps down the passage when something hit the back of his neck an
agonizingly painful blow. It was as though a red-hot wire had been jabbed
into him. He spun round just in time to see Mrs Parsons dragging her son
back into the doorway while the boy pocketed a catapult.

Goldstein! bellowed the boy as the door closed on him. But what most
struck Winston was the look of helpless fright on the womans greyish face.",1984,"Orwell, George"
884,Back in the flat he stepped quickly past the telescreen and sat down at the,1984,"Orwell, George"
885,"table again, still rubbing his neck. The music from the telescreen had",1984,"Orwell, George"
886,"stopped. Instead, a clipped military voice was reading out, with a sort of",1984,"Orwell, George"
887,"brutal relish, a description of the armaments of the new Floating Fortress",1984,"Orwell, George"
888,which had just been anchored between Iceland and the Faroe Islands.,1984,"Orwell, George"
889,"With those children, he thought, that wretched woman must lead a life of",1984,"Orwell, George"
890,"terror. Another year, two years, and they would be watching her night",1984,"Orwell, George"
891,and day for symptoms of unorthodoxy. Nearly all children nowadays were,1984,"Orwell, George"
892,horrible. What was worst of all was that by means of such organizations as,1984,"Orwell, George"
893,"the Spies they were systematically turned into ungovernable little savages,",1984,"Orwell, George"
894,and yet this produced in them no tendency whatever to rebel against the,1984,"Orwell, George"
895,"discipline of the Party. On the contrary, they adored the Party and",1984,"Orwell, George"
896,"everything connected with it. The songs, the processions, the banners, the",1984,"Orwell, George"
897,"hiking, the drilling with dummy rifles, the yelling of slogans, the worship",1984,"Orwell, George"
898,of Big Brother--it was all a sort of glorious game to them. All their,1984,"Orwell, George"
899,"ferocity was turned outwards, against the enemies of the State, against",1984,"Orwell, George"
900,"foreigners, traitors, saboteurs, thought-criminals. It was almost normal",1984,"Orwell, George"
901,for people over thirty to be frightened of their own children. And with,1984,"Orwell, George"
902,"good reason, for hardly a week passed in which The Times did not carry",1984,"Orwell, George"
903,a paragraph describing how some eavesdropping little sneak--child hero,1984,"Orwell, George"
904,was the phrase generally used--had overheard some compromising remark,1984,"Orwell, George"
905,and denounced its parents to the Thought Police.,1984,"Orwell, George"
906,The sting of the catapult bullet had worn off. He picked up his pen,1984,"Orwell, George"
907,"half-heartedly, wondering whether he could find something more to write",1984,"Orwell, George"
908,"in the diary. Suddenly he began thinking of OBrien again.

Years ago--how long was it? Seven years it must be--he had dreamed that he
was walking through a pitch-dark room. And someone sitting to one side of
him had said as he passed: We shall meet in the place where there is no",1984,"Orwell, George"
909,"darkness. It was said very quietly, almost casually--a statement, not a
command. He had walked on without pausing. What was curious was that at the
time, in the dream, the words had not made much impression on him. It was
only later and by degrees that they had seemed to take on significance. He
could not now remember whether it was before or after having the dream that
he had seen OBrien for the first time, nor could he remember when he had",1984,"Orwell, George"
910,first identified the voice as OBriens. But at any rate the identification,1984,"Orwell, George"
911,"existed. It was OBrien who had spoken to him out of the dark.

Winston had never been able to feel sure--even after this mornings flash",1984,"Orwell, George"
912,"of the eyes it was still impossible to be sure whether OBrien was a friend
or an enemy. Nor did it even seem to matter greatly. There was a link of
understanding between them, more important than affection or partisanship.
We shall meet in the place where there is no darkness, he had said.
Winston did not know what it meant, only that in some way or another it
would come true.

The voice from the telescreen paused. A trumpet call, clear and beautiful,
floated into the stagnant air. The voice continued raspingly:

Attention! Your attention, please! A newsflash has this moment arrived",1984,"Orwell, George"
913,from the Malabar front. Our forces in South India have won a glorious,1984,"Orwell, George"
914,victory. I am authorized to say that the action we are now reporting may,1984,"Orwell, George"
915,well bring the war within measurable distance of its end. Here is the,1984,"Orwell, George"
916,"newsflash----

Bad news coming, thought Winston. And sure enough, following on a gory
description of the annihilation of a Eurasian army, with stupendous figures
of killed and prisoners, came the announcement that, as from next week,
the chocolate ration would be reduced from thirty grammes to twenty.

Winston belched again. The gin was wearing off, leaving a deflated feeling.
The telescreen--perhaps to celebrate the victory, perhaps to drown the
memory of the lost chocolate--crashed into Oceania, tis for thee. You",1984,"Orwell, George"
917,"were supposed to stand to attention. However, in his present position he",1984,"Orwell, George"
918,was invisible.,1984,"Orwell, George"
919,"Oceania, tis for thee gave way to lighter music. Winston walked over to
the window, keeping his back to the telescreen. The day was still cold and
clear. Somewhere far away a rocket bomb exploded with a dull, reverberating
roar. About twenty or thirty of them a week were falling on London at
present.

Down in the street the wind flapped the torn poster to and fro, and the
word INGSOC fitfully appeared and vanished. Ingsoc. The sacred principles
of Ingsoc. Newspeak, doublethink, the mutability of the past. He felt as
though he were wandering in the forests of the sea bottom, lost in a
monstrous world where he himself was the monster. He was alone. The past
was dead, the future was unimaginable. What certainty had he that a single
human creature now living was on his side? And what way of knowing that the
dominion of the Party would not endure FOR EVER? Like an answer, the three
slogans on the white face of the Ministry of Truth came back to him:


  WAR IS PEACE
  FREEDOM IS SLAVERY
  IGNORANCE IS STRENGTH


He took a twenty-five cent piece out of his pocket. There, too, in tiny
clear lettering, the same slogans were inscribed, and on the other face of
the coin the head of Big Brother. Even from the coin the eyes pursued you.
On coins, on stamps, on the covers of books, on banners, on posters, and on
the wrappings of a cigarette packet--everywhere. Always the eyes watching
you and the voice enveloping you. Asleep or awake, working or eating,
indoors or out of doors, in the bath or in bed--no escape. Nothing was your
own except the few cubic centimetres inside your skull.

The sun had shifted round, and the myriad windows of the Ministry of Truth,
with the light no longer shining on them, looked grim as the loopholes of a
fortress. His heart quailed before the enormous pyramidal shape. It was too
strong, it could not be stormed. A thousand rocket bombs would not batter
it down. He wondered again for whom he was writing the diary. For the
future, for the past--for an age that might be imaginary. And in front of
him there lay not death but annihilation. The diary would be reduced to
ashes and himself to vapour. Only the Thought Police would read what he had
written, before they wiped it out of existence and out of memory. How could
you make appeal to the future when not a trace of you, not even an
anonymous word scribbled on a piece of paper, could physically survive?

The telescreen struck fourteen. He must leave in ten minutes. He had to be
back at work by fourteen-thirty.

Curiously, the chiming of the hour seemed to have put new heart into him.
He was a lonely ghost uttering a truth that nobody would ever hear. But so
long as he uttered it, in some obscure way the continuity was not broken.
It was not by making yourself heard but by staying sane that you carried on
the human heritage. He went back to the table, dipped his pen, and wrote:


   To the future or to the past, to a time when thought is free, when men
are different from one another and do not live alone--to a time when truth
exists and what is done cannot be undone:
   From the age of uniformity, from the age of solitude, from the age of
Big Brother, from the age of doublethink--greetings!


He was already dead, he reflected. It seemed to him that it was only now,
when he had begun to be able to formulate his thoughts, that he had taken
the decisive step. The consequences of every act are included in the act
itself. He wrote:


   Thoughtcrime does not entail death: thoughtcrime IS death.


Now he had recognized himself as a dead man it became important to stay
alive as long as possible. Two fingers of his right hand were inkstained.
It was exactly the kind of detail that might betray you. Some nosing zealot
in the Ministry (a woman, probably: someone like the little sandy-haired
woman or the dark-haired girl from the Fiction Department) might start
wondering why he had been writing during the lunch interval, why he had
used an old-fashioned pen, WHAT he had been writing--and then drop a hint
in the appropriate quarter. He went to the bathroom and carefully scrubbed
the ink away with the gritty dark-brown soap which rasped your skin like
sandpaper and was therefore well adapted for this purpose.

He put the diary away in the drawer. It was quite useless to think of
hiding it, but he could at least make sure whether or not its existence had
been discovered. A hair laid across the page-ends was too obvious. With the
tip of his finger he picked up an identifiable grain of whitish dust and
deposited it on the corner of the cover, where it was bound to be shaken
off if the book was moved.




Chapter 3



Winston was dreaming of his mother.

He must, he thought, have been ten or eleven years old when his mother had
disappeared. She was a tall, statuesque, rather silent woman with slow
movements and magnificent fair hair. His father he remembered more vaguely
as dark and thin, dressed always in neat dark clothes (Winston remembered
especially the very thin soles of his fathers shoes) and wearing",1984,"Orwell, George"
920,spectacles. The two of them must evidently have been swallowed up in one,1984,"Orwell, George"
921,of the first great purges of the fifties.,1984,"Orwell, George"
922,"At this moment his mother was sitting in some place deep down beneath him,",1984,"Orwell, George"
923,"with his young sister in her arms. He did not remember his sister at all,",1984,"Orwell, George"
924,"except as a tiny, feeble baby, always silent, with large, watchful eyes.",1984,"Orwell, George"
925,Both of them were looking up at him. They were down in some subterranean,1984,"Orwell, George"
926,"place--the bottom of a well, for instance, or a very deep grave--but it",1984,"Orwell, George"
927,"was a place which, already far below him, was itself moving downwards.",1984,"Orwell, George"
928,"They were in the saloon of a sinking ship, looking up at him through the",1984,"Orwell, George"
929,"darkening water. There was still air in the saloon, they could still see",1984,"Orwell, George"
930,"him and he them, but all the while they were sinking down, down into the",1984,"Orwell, George"
931,green waters which in another moment must hide them from sight for ever.,1984,"Orwell, George"
932,"He was out in the light and air while they were being sucked down to death,",1984,"Orwell, George"
933,and they were down there because he was up here. He knew it and they knew,1984,"Orwell, George"
934,"it, and he could see the knowledge in their faces. There was no reproach",1984,"Orwell, George"
935,"either in their faces or in their hearts, only the knowledge that they",1984,"Orwell, George"
936,"must die in order that he might remain alive, and that this was part of",1984,"Orwell, George"
937,the unavoidable order of things.,1984,"Orwell, George"
938,"He could not remember what had happened, but he knew in his dream that in",1984,"Orwell, George"
939,some way the lives of his mother and his sister had been sacrificed to his,1984,"Orwell, George"
940,"own. It was one of those dreams which, while retaining the characteristic",1984,"Orwell, George"
941,"dream scenery, are a continuation of ones intellectual life, and in which
one becomes aware of facts and ideas which still seem new and valuable
after one is awake. The thing that now suddenly struck Winston was that his
mothers death, nearly thirty years ago, had been tragic and sorrowful in",1984,"Orwell, George"
942,"a way that was no longer possible. Tragedy, he perceived, belonged to the",1984,"Orwell, George"
943,"ancient time, to a time when there was still privacy, love, and friendship,",1984,"Orwell, George"
944,and when the members of a family stood by one another without needing to,1984,"Orwell, George"
945,"know the reason. His mothers memory tore at his heart because she had died
loving him, when he was too young and selfish to love her in return, and
because somehow, he did not remember how, she had sacrificed herself to a
conception of loyalty that was private and unalterable. Such things, he
saw, could not happen today. Today there were fear, hatred, and pain, but
no dignity of emotion, no deep or complex sorrows. All this he seemed to
see in the large eyes of his mother and his sister, looking up at him
through the green water, hundreds of fathoms down and still sinking.

Suddenly he was standing on short springy turf, on a summer evening when
the slanting rays of the sun gilded the ground. The landscape that he was
looking at recurred so often in his dreams that he was never fully certain
whether or not he had seen it in the real world. In his waking thoughts he
called it the Golden Country. It was an old, rabbit-bitten pasture, with a
foot-track wandering across it and a molehill here and there. In the ragged
hedge on the opposite side of the field the boughs of the elm trees were
swaying very faintly in the breeze, their leaves just stirring in dense
masses like womens hair. Somewhere near at hand, though out of sight,",1984,"Orwell, George"
946,"there was a clear, slow-moving stream where dace were swimming in the",1984,"Orwell, George"
947,pools under the willow trees.,1984,"Orwell, George"
948,The girl with dark hair was coming towards them across the field. With,1984,"Orwell, George"
949,what seemed a single movement she tore off her clothes and flung them,1984,"Orwell, George"
950,"disdainfully aside. Her body was white and smooth, but it aroused no desire",1984,"Orwell, George"
951,"in him, indeed he barely looked at it. What overwhelmed him in that instant",1984,"Orwell, George"
952,was admiration for the gesture with which she had thrown her clothes aside.,1984,"Orwell, George"
953,"With its grace and carelessness it seemed to annihilate a whole culture,",1984,"Orwell, George"
954,"a whole system of thought, as though Big Brother and the Party and the",1984,"Orwell, George"
955,Thought Police could all be swept into nothingness by a single splendid,1984,"Orwell, George"
956,movement of the arm. That too was a gesture belonging to the ancient time.,1984,"Orwell, George"
957,Winston woke up with the word Shakespeare on his lips.,1984,"Orwell, George"
958,The telescreen was giving forth an ear-splitting whistle which continued on,1984,"Orwell, George"
959,"the same note for thirty seconds. It was nought seven fifteen, getting-up",1984,"Orwell, George"
960,"time for office workers. Winston wrenched his body out of bed--naked, for",1984,"Orwell, George"
961,"a member of the Outer Party received only 3,000 clothing coupons annually,",1984,"Orwell, George"
962,and a suit of pyjamas was 600--and seized a dingy singlet and a pair of,1984,"Orwell, George"
963,shorts that were lying across a chair. The Physical Jerks would begin in,1984,"Orwell, George"
964,three minutes. The next moment he was doubled up by a violent coughing fit,1984,"Orwell, George"
965,which nearly always attacked him soon after waking up. It emptied his lungs,1984,"Orwell, George"
966,so completely that he could only begin breathing again by lying on his back,1984,"Orwell, George"
967,and taking a series of deep gasps. His veins had swelled with the effort of,1984,"Orwell, George"
968,"the cough, and the varicose ulcer had started itching.",1984,"Orwell, George"
969,"Thirty to forty group! yapped a piercing female voice. Thirty to forty
group! Take your places, please. Thirties to forties!",1984,"Orwell, George"
970,"Winston sprang to attention in front of the telescreen, upon which the",1984,"Orwell, George"
971,"image of a youngish woman, scrawny but muscular, dressed in tunic and",1984,"Orwell, George"
972,"gym-shoes, had already appeared.",1984,"Orwell, George"
973,"Arms bending and stretching! she rapped out. Take your time by me. ONE,
two, three, four! ONE, two, three, four! Come on, comrades, put a bit of
life into it! ONE, two, three four! ONE two, three, four!...",1984,"Orwell, George"
974,"The pain of the coughing fit had not quite driven out of Winstons mind the
impression made by his dream, and the rhythmic movements of the exercise
restored it somewhat. As he mechanically shot his arms back and forth,
wearing on his face the look of grim enjoyment which was considered proper
during the Physical Jerks, he was struggling to think his way backward into
the dim period of his early childhood. It was extraordinarily difficult.
Beyond the late fifties everything faded. When there were no external
records that you could refer to, even the outline of your own life lost
its sharpness. You remembered huge events which had quite probably not
happened, you remembered the detail of incidents without being able to
recapture their atmosphere, and there were long blank periods to which you
could assign nothing. Everything had been different then. Even the names of
countries, and their shapes on the map, had been different. Airstrip One,
for instance, had not been so called in those days: it had been called
England or Britain, though London, he felt fairly certain, had always been
called London.

Winston could not definitely remember a time when his country had not been
at war, but it was evident that there had been a fairly long interval of
peace during his childhood, because one of his early memories was of an air
raid which appeared to take everyone by surprise. Perhaps it was the time
when the atomic bomb had fallen on Colchester. He did not remember the raid
itself, but he did remember his fathers hand clutching his own as they",1984,"Orwell, George"
975,"hurried down, down, down into some place deep in the earth, round and round",1984,"Orwell, George"
976,a spiral staircase which rang under his feet and which finally so wearied,1984,"Orwell, George"
977,his legs that he began whimpering and they had to stop and rest. His,1984,"Orwell, George"
978,"mother, in her slow, dreamy way, was following a long way behind them. She",1984,"Orwell, George"
979,was carrying his baby sister--or perhaps it was only a bundle of blankets,1984,"Orwell, George"
980,that she was carrying: he was not certain whether his sister had been born,1984,"Orwell, George"
981,"then. Finally they had emerged into a noisy, crowded place which he had",1984,"Orwell, George"
982,realized to be a Tube station.,1984,"Orwell, George"
983,"There were people sitting all over the stone-flagged floor, and other",1984,"Orwell, George"
984,"people, packed tightly together, were sitting on metal bunks, one above",1984,"Orwell, George"
985,the other. Winston and his mother and father found themselves a place on,1984,"Orwell, George"
986,"the floor, and near them an old man and an old woman were sitting side by",1984,"Orwell, George"
987,side on a bunk. The old man had on a decent dark suit and a black cloth cap,1984,"Orwell, George"
988,pushed back from very white hair: his face was scarlet and his eyes were,1984,"Orwell, George"
989,blue and full of tears. He reeked of gin. It seemed to breathe out of his,1984,"Orwell, George"
990,"skin in place of sweat, and one could have fancied that the tears welling",1984,"Orwell, George"
991,from his eyes were pure gin. But though slightly drunk he was also,1984,"Orwell, George"
992,suffering under some grief that was genuine and unbearable. In his childish,1984,"Orwell, George"
993,"way Winston grasped that some terrible thing, something that was beyond",1984,"Orwell, George"
994,"forgiveness and could never be remedied, had just happened. It also seemed",1984,"Orwell, George"
995,to him that he knew what it was. Someone whom the old man loved--a little,1984,"Orwell, George"
996,"granddaughter, perhaps--had been killed. Every few minutes the old man kept",1984,"Orwell, George"
997,repeating:,1984,"Orwell, George"

999,"comes of trusting em. I said so all along. We didnt ought to ave trusted
the buggers.",1984,"Orwell, George"
1000,"But which buggers they didnt ought to have trusted Winston could not now
remember.

Since about that time, war had been literally continuous, though strictly
speaking it had not always been the same war. For several months during his
childhood there had been confused street fighting in London itself, some
of which he remembered vividly. But to trace out the history of the whole
period, to say who was fighting whom at any given moment, would have been
utterly impossible, since no written record, and no spoken word, ever made
mention of any other alignment than the existing one. At this moment, for
example, in 1984 (if it was 1984), Oceania was at war with Eurasia and
in alliance with Eastasia. In no public or private utterance was it ever
admitted that the three powers had at any time been grouped along different
lines. Actually, as Winston well knew, it was only four years since Oceania
had been at war with Eastasia and in alliance with Eurasia. But that was
merely a piece of furtive knowledge which he happened to possess because
his memory was not satisfactorily under control. Officially the change of
partners had never happened. Oceania was at war with Eurasia: therefore
Oceania had always been at war with Eurasia. The enemy of the moment always
represented absolute evil, and it followed that any past or future
agreement with him was impossible.

The frightening thing, he reflected for the ten thousandth time as he
forced his shoulders painfully backward (with hands on hips, they were
gyrating their bodies from the waist, an exercise that was supposed to be
good for the back muscles)--the frightening thing was that it might all be
true. If the Party could thrust its hand into the past and say of this or
that event, IT NEVER HAPPENED--that, surely, was more terrifying than mere
torture and death?

The Party said that Oceania had never been in alliance with Eurasia. He,
Winston Smith, knew that Oceania had been in alliance with Eurasia as short
a time as four years ago. But where did that knowledge exist? Only in his
own consciousness, which in any case must soon be annihilated. And if all
others accepted the lie which the Party imposed--if all records told the
same tale--then the lie passed into history and became truth. Who controls",1984,"Orwell, George"
1001,"the past, ran the Party slogan, controls the future: who controls the",1984,"Orwell, George"
1002,"present controls the past. And yet the past, though of its nature
alterable, never had been altered. Whatever was true now was true from
everlasting to everlasting. It was quite simple. All that was needed was
an unending series of victories over your own memory. Reality control,
they called it: in Newspeak, doublethink.

Stand easy! barked the instructress, a little more genially.

Winston sank his arms to his sides and slowly refilled his lungs with air.
His mind slid away into the labyrinthine world of doublethink. To know
and not to know, to be conscious of complete truthfulness while telling
carefully constructed lies, to hold simultaneously two opinions which
cancelled out, knowing them to be contradictory and believing in both of
them, to use logic against logic, to repudiate morality while laying claim
to it, to believe that democracy was impossible and that the Party was the
guardian of democracy, to forget whatever it was necessary to forget, then
to draw it back into memory again at the moment when it was needed, and
then promptly to forget it again: and above all, to apply the same process
to the process itself. That was the ultimate subtlety: consciously to
induce unconsciousness, and then, once again, to become unconscious of
the act of hypnosis you had just performed. Even to understand the word
doublethink involved the use of doublethink.

The instructress had called them to attention again. And now lets see
which of us can touch our toes! she said enthusiastically. Right over
from the hips, please, comrades. ONE-two! ONE-two!...",1984,"Orwell, George"
1003,"Winston loathed this exercise, which sent shooting pains all the way from",1984,"Orwell, George"
1004,his heels to his buttocks and often ended by bringing on another coughing,1984,"Orwell, George"
1005,"fit. The half-pleasant quality went out of his meditations. The past, he",1984,"Orwell, George"
1006,"reflected, had not merely been altered, it had been actually destroyed. For",1984,"Orwell, George"
1007,how could you establish even the most obvious fact when there existed no,1984,"Orwell, George"
1008,record outside your own memory? He tried to remember in what year he had,1984,"Orwell, George"
1009,first heard mention of Big Brother. He thought it must have been at some,1984,"Orwell, George"
1010,"time in the sixties, but it was impossible to be certain. In the Party",1984,"Orwell, George"
1011,"histories, of course, Big Brother figured as the leader and guardian of the",1984,"Orwell, George"
1012,Revolution since its very earliest days. His exploits had been gradually,1984,"Orwell, George"
1013,pushed backwards in time until already they extended into the fabulous,1984,"Orwell, George"
1014,"world of the forties and the thirties, when the capitalists in their",1984,"Orwell, George"
1015,strange cylindrical hats still rode through the streets of London in great,1984,"Orwell, George"
1016,gleaming motor-cars or horse carriages with glass sides. There was no,1984,"Orwell, George"
1017,knowing how much of this legend was true and how much invented. Winston,1984,"Orwell, George"
1018,could not even remember at what date the Party itself had come into,1984,"Orwell, George"
1019,existence. He did not believe he had ever heard the word Ingsoc before,1984,"Orwell, George"
1020,"1960, but it was possible that in its Oldspeak form--English Socialism,",1984,"Orwell, George"
1021,that is to say--it had been current earlier. Everything melted into mist.,1984,"Orwell, George"
1022,"Sometimes, indeed, you could put your finger on a definite lie. It was not",1984,"Orwell, George"
1023,"true, for example, as was claimed in the Party history books, that the",1984,"Orwell, George"
1024,Party had invented aeroplanes. He remembered aeroplanes since his earliest,1984,"Orwell, George"
1025,childhood. But you could prove nothing. There was never any evidence. Just,1984,"Orwell, George"
1026,once in his whole life he had held in his hands unmistakable documentary,1984,"Orwell, George"
1027,proof of the falsification of an historical fact. And on that occasion----,1984,"Orwell, George"
1028,"Smith! screamed the shrewish voice from the telescreen. 6079 Smith W.!
Yes, YOU! Bend lower, please! You can do better than that. Youre not",1984,"Orwell, George"
1029,"trying. Lower, please! THATS better, comrade. Now stand at ease, the
whole squad, and watch me.",1984,"Orwell, George"
1030,"A sudden hot sweat had broken out all over Winstons body. His face
remained completely inscrutable. Never show dismay! Never show resentment!
A single flicker of the eyes could give you away. He stood watching while
the instructress raised her arms above her head and--one could not say
gracefully, but with remarkable neatness and efficiency--bent over and
tucked the first joint of her fingers under her toes.

THERE, comrades! THATS how I want to see you doing it. Watch me again.
Im thirty-nine and Ive had four children. Now look. She bent over again.",1984,"Orwell, George"
1031,"You see MY knees arent bent. You can all do it if you want to, she added
as she straightened herself up. Anyone under forty-five is perfectly",1984,"Orwell, George"
1032,"capable of touching his toes. We dont all have the privilege of fighting
in the front line, but at least we can all keep fit. Remember our boys on
the Malabar front! And the sailors in the Floating Fortresses! Just think
what THEY have to put up with. Now try again. Thats better, comrade,",1984,"Orwell, George"
1033,"thats MUCH better, she added encouragingly as Winston, with a violent",1984,"Orwell, George"
1034,"lunge, succeeded in touching his toes with knees unbent, for the first",1984,"Orwell, George"
1035,time in several years.,1984,"Orwell, George"
1036,Chapter 4,1984,"Orwell, George"
1037,"With the deep, unconscious sigh which not even the nearness of the",1984,"Orwell, George"
1038,"telescreen could prevent him from uttering when his days work started,
Winston pulled the speakwrite towards him, blew the dust from its
mouthpiece, and put on his spectacles. Then he unrolled and clipped
together four small cylinders of paper which had already flopped out of
the pneumatic tube on the right-hand side of his desk.

In the walls of the cubicle there were three orifices. To the right of the
speakwrite, a small pneumatic tube for written messages, to the left, a
larger one for newspapers; and in the side wall, within easy reach of
Winstons arm, a large oblong slit protected by a wire grating. This last",1984,"Orwell, George"
1039,was for the disposal of waste paper. Similar slits existed in thousands or,1984,"Orwell, George"
1040,"tens of thousands throughout the building, not only in every room but at",1984,"Orwell, George"
1041,short intervals in every corridor. For some reason they were nicknamed,1984,"Orwell, George"
1042,"memory holes. When one knew that any document was due for destruction, or",1984,"Orwell, George"
1043,"even when one saw a scrap of waste paper lying about, it was an automatic",1984,"Orwell, George"
1044,"action to lift the flap of the nearest memory hole and drop it in,",1984,"Orwell, George"
1045,whereupon it would be whirled away on a current of warm air to the enormous,1984,"Orwell, George"
1046,furnaces which were hidden somewhere in the recesses of the building.,1984,"Orwell, George"
1047,Winston examined the four slips of paper which he had unrolled. Each,1984,"Orwell, George"
1048,"contained a message of only one or two lines, in the abbreviated",1984,"Orwell, George"
1049,"jargon--not actually Newspeak, but consisting",1984,"Orwell, George"
1050,largely of Newspeak words--which was used in the Ministry for internal,1984,"Orwell, George"
1051,purposes. They ran:,1984,"Orwell, George"

1057,With a faint feeling of satisfaction Winston laid the fourth message aside.,1984,"Orwell, George"
1058,It was an intricate and responsible job and had better be dealt with last.,1984,"Orwell, George"
1059,"The other three were routine matters, though the second one would probably",1984,"Orwell, George"
1060,mean some tedious wading through lists of figures.,1984,"Orwell, George"
1061,Winston dialled back numbers on the telescreen and called for the,1984,"Orwell, George"
1062,"appropriate issues of The Times, which slid out of the pneumatic tube",1984,"Orwell, George"
1063,"after only a few minutes delay. The messages he had received referred to
articles or news items which for one reason or another it was thought
necessary to alter, or, as the official phrase had it, to rectify. For
example, it appeared from The Times of the seventeenth of March that Big
Brother, in his speech of the previous day, had predicted that the South
Indian front would remain quiet but that a Eurasian offensive would shortly
be launched in North Africa. As it happened, the Eurasian Higher Command
had launched its offensive in South India and left North Africa alone. It
was therefore necessary to rewrite a paragraph of Big Brothers speech, in",1984,"Orwell, George"
1064,such a way as to make him predict the thing that had actually happened. Or,1984,"Orwell, George"
1065,"again, The Times of the nineteenth of December had published the official",1984,"Orwell, George"
1066,forecasts of the output of various classes of consumption goods in the,1984,"Orwell, George"
1067,"fourth quarter of 1983, which was also the sixth quarter of the Ninth",1984,"Orwell, George"
1068,"Three-Year Plan. Todays issue contained a statement of the actual output,
from which it appeared that the forecasts were in every instance grossly
wrong. Winstons job was to rectify the original figures by making them",1984,"Orwell, George"
1069,"agree with the later ones. As for the third message, it referred to a very",1984,"Orwell, George"
1070,simple error which could be set right in a couple of minutes. As short,1984,"Orwell, George"
1071,"a time ago as February, the Ministry of Plenty had issued a promise",1984,"Orwell, George"
1072,(a categorical pledge were the official words) that there would be,1984,"Orwell, George"
1073,"no reduction of the chocolate ration during 1984. Actually, as Winston",1984,"Orwell, George"
1074,"was aware, the chocolate ration was to be reduced from thirty grammes",1984,"Orwell, George"
1075,to twenty at the end of the present week. All that was needed was to,1984,"Orwell, George"
1076,substitute for the original promise a warning that it would probably be,1984,"Orwell, George"
1077,necessary to reduce the ration at some time in April.,1984,"Orwell, George"
1078,"As soon as Winston had dealt with each of the messages, he clipped his",1984,"Orwell, George"
1079,speakwritten corrections to the appropriate copy of The Times and pushed,1984,"Orwell, George"
1080,"them into the pneumatic tube. Then, with a movement which was as nearly as",1984,"Orwell, George"
1081,"possible unconscious, he crumpled up the original message and any notes",1984,"Orwell, George"
1082,"that he himself had made, and dropped them into the memory hole to be",1984,"Orwell, George"
1083,devoured by the flames.,1984,"Orwell, George"
1084,"What happened in the unseen labyrinth to which the pneumatic tubes led, he",1984,"Orwell, George"
1085,"did not know in detail, but he did know in general terms. As soon as all",1984,"Orwell, George"
1086,the corrections which happened to be necessary in any particular number,1984,"Orwell, George"
1087,"of The Times had been assembled and collated, that number would be",1984,"Orwell, George"
1088,"reprinted, the original copy destroyed, and the corrected copy placed on",1984,"Orwell, George"
1089,the files in its stead. This process of continuous alteration was applied,1984,"Orwell, George"
1090,"not only to newspapers, but to books, periodicals, pamphlets, posters,",1984,"Orwell, George"
1091,"leaflets, films, sound-tracks, cartoons, photographs--to every kind of",1984,"Orwell, George"
1092,literature or documentation which might conceivably hold any political or,1984,"Orwell, George"
1093,ideological significance. Day by day and almost minute by minute the past,1984,"Orwell, George"
1094,was brought up to date. In this way every prediction made by the Party,1984,"Orwell, George"
1095,"could be shown by documentary evidence to have been correct, nor was any",1984,"Orwell, George"
1096,"item of news, or any expression of opinion, which conflicted with the",1984,"Orwell, George"
1097,"needs of the moment, ever allowed to remain on record. All history was",1984,"Orwell, George"
1098,"a palimpsest, scraped clean and reinscribed exactly as often as was",1984,"Orwell, George"
1099,"necessary. In no case would it have been possible, once the deed was done,",1984,"Orwell, George"
1100,to prove that any falsification had taken place. The largest section of,1984,"Orwell, George"
1101,"the Records Department, far larger than the one on which Winston worked,",1984,"Orwell, George"
1102,consisted simply of persons whose duty it was to track down and collect all,1984,"Orwell, George"
1103,"copies of books, newspapers, and other documents which had been superseded",1984,"Orwell, George"
1104,"and were due for destruction. A number of The Times which might, because",1984,"Orwell, George"
1105,"of changes in political alignment, or mistaken prophecies uttered by Big",1984,"Orwell, George"
1106,"Brother, have been rewritten a dozen times still stood on the files bearing",1984,"Orwell, George"
1107,"its original date, and no other copy existed to contradict it. Books, also,",1984,"Orwell, George"
1108,"were recalled and rewritten again and again, and were invariably reissued",1984,"Orwell, George"
1109,without any admission that any alteration had been made. Even the written,1984,"Orwell, George"
1110,"instructions which Winston received, and which he invariably got rid of",1984,"Orwell, George"
1111,"as soon as he had dealt with them, never stated or implied that an act of",1984,"Orwell, George"
1112,"forgery was to be committed: always the reference was to slips, errors,",1984,"Orwell, George"
1113,"misprints, or misquotations which it was necessary to put right in the",1984,"Orwell, George"
1114,interests of accuracy.,1984,"Orwell, George"
1115,"But actually, he thought as he re-adjusted the Ministry of Plentys
figures, it was not even forgery. It was merely the substitution of one
piece of nonsense for another. Most of the material that you were dealing
with had no connexion with anything in the real world, not even the kind of
connexion that is contained in a direct lie. Statistics were just as much
a fantasy in their original version as in their rectified version. A great
deal of the time you were expected to make them up out of your head. For
example, the Ministry of Plentys forecast had estimated the output of",1984,"Orwell, George"
1116,boots for the quarter at 145 million pairs. The actual output was given as,1984,"Orwell, George"
1117,"sixty-two millions. Winston, however, in rewriting the forecast, marked",1984,"Orwell, George"
1118,"the figure down to fifty-seven millions, so as to allow for the usual claim",1984,"Orwell, George"
1119,"that the quota had been overfulfilled. In any case, sixty-two millions was",1984,"Orwell, George"
1120,"no nearer the truth than fifty-seven millions, or than 145 millions. Very",1984,"Orwell, George"
1121,"likely no boots had been produced at all. Likelier still, nobody knew",1984,"Orwell, George"
1122,"how many had been produced, much less cared. All one knew was that every",1984,"Orwell, George"
1123,"quarter astronomical numbers of boots were produced on paper, while perhaps",1984,"Orwell, George"
1124,half the population of Oceania went barefoot. And so it was with every,1984,"Orwell, George"
1125,"class of recorded fact, great or small. Everything faded away into a",1984,"Orwell, George"
1126,"shadow-world in which, finally, even the date of the year had become",1984,"Orwell, George"
1127,uncertain.,1984,"Orwell, George"
1128,Winston glanced across the hall. In the corresponding cubicle on the other,1984,"Orwell, George"
1129,"side a small, precise-looking, dark-chinned man named Tillotson was working",1984,"Orwell, George"
1130,"steadily away, with a folded newspaper on his knee and his mouth very close",1984,"Orwell, George"
1131,to the mouthpiece of the speakwrite. He had the air of trying to keep what,1984,"Orwell, George"
1132,"he was saying a secret between himself and the telescreen. He looked up,",1984,"Orwell, George"
1133,"and his spectacles darted a hostile flash in Winstons direction.

Winston hardly knew Tillotson, and had no idea what work he was employed
on. People in the Records Department did not readily talk about their jobs.
In the long, windowless hall, with its double row of cubicles and its
endless rustle of papers and hum of voices murmuring into speakwrites,
there were quite a dozen people whom Winston did not even know by name,
though he daily saw them hurrying to and fro in the corridors or
gesticulating in the Two Minutes Hate. He knew that in the cubicle next
to him the little woman with sandy hair toiled day in day out, simply at
tracking down and deleting from the Press the names of people who had been
vaporized and were therefore considered never to have existed. There was a
certain fitness in this, since her own husband had been vaporized a couple
of years earlier. And a few cubicles away a mild, ineffectual, dreamy
creature named Ampleforth, with very hairy ears and a surprising talent
for juggling with rhymes and metres, was engaged in producing garbled
versions--definitive texts, they were called--of poems which had become
ideologically offensive, but which for one reason or another were to be
retained in the anthologies. And this hall, with its fifty workers or
thereabouts, was only one sub-section, a single cell, as it were, in the
huge complexity of the Records Department. Beyond, above, below, were other
swarms of workers engaged in an unimaginable multitude of jobs. There were
the huge printing-shops with their sub-editors, their typography experts,
and their elaborately equipped studios for the faking of photographs. There
was the tele-programmes section with its engineers, its producers, and its
teams of actors specially chosen for their skill in imitating voices. There
were the armies of reference clerks whose job was simply to draw up lists
of books and periodicals which were due for recall. There were the vast
repositories where the corrected documents were stored, and the hidden
furnaces where the original copies were destroyed. And somewhere or other,
quite anonymous, there were the directing brains who co-ordinated the whole
effort and laid down the lines of policy which made it necessary that this
fragment of the past should be preserved, that one falsified, and the other
rubbed out of existence.

And the Records Department, after all, was itself only a single branch of
the Ministry of Truth, whose primary job was not to reconstruct the past
but to supply the citizens of Oceania with newspapers, films, textbooks,
telescreen programmes, plays, novels--with every conceivable kind of
information, instruction, or entertainment, from a statue to a slogan,
from a lyric poem to a biological treatise, and from a childs",1984,"Orwell, George"
1134,spelling-book to a Newspeak dictionary. And the Ministry had not only to,1984,"Orwell, George"
1135,"supply the multifarious needs of the party, but also to repeat the whole",1984,"Orwell, George"
1136,operation at a lower level for the benefit of the proletariat. There,1984,"Orwell, George"
1137,was a whole chain of separate departments dealing with proletarian,1984,"Orwell, George"
1138,"literature, music, drama, and entertainment generally. Here were produced",1984,"Orwell, George"
1139,"rubbishy newspapers containing almost nothing except sport, crime and",1984,"Orwell, George"
1140,"astrology, sensational five-cent novelettes, films oozing with sex, and",1984,"Orwell, George"
1141,sentimental songs which were composed entirely by mechanical means on a,1984,"Orwell, George"
1142,special kind of kaleidoscope known as a versificator. There was even,1984,"Orwell, George"
1143,"a whole sub-section--Pornosec, it was called in Newspeak--engaged in",1984,"Orwell, George"
1144,"producing the lowest kind of pornography, which was sent out in sealed",1984,"Orwell, George"
1145,"packets and which no Party member, other than those who worked on it,",1984,"Orwell, George"
1146,was permitted to look at.,1984,"Orwell, George"
1147,Three messages had slid out of the pneumatic tube while Winston was,1984,"Orwell, George"
1148,"working, but they were simple matters, and he had disposed of them before",1984,"Orwell, George"
1149,the Two Minutes Hate interrupted him. When the Hate was over he returned,1984,"Orwell, George"
1150,"to his cubicle, took the Newspeak dictionary from the shelf, pushed the",1984,"Orwell, George"
1151,"speakwrite to one side, cleaned his spectacles, and settled down to his",1984,"Orwell, George"
1152,main job of the morning.,1984,"Orwell, George"
1153,"Winstons greatest pleasure in life was in his work. Most of it was a
tedious routine, but included in it there were also jobs so difficult and
intricate that you could lose yourself in them as in the depths of a
mathematical problem--delicate pieces of forgery in which you had nothing
to guide you except your knowledge of the principles of Ingsoc and your
estimate of what the Party wanted you to say. Winston was good at this kind
of thing. On occasion he had even been entrusted with the rectification of
The Times leading articles, which were written entirely in Newspeak.
He unrolled the message that he had set aside earlier. It ran:


   times 3.12.83 reporting bb dayorder doubleplusungood refs unpersons
rewrite fullwise upsub antefiling


In Oldspeak (or standard English) this might be rendered:


The reporting of Big Brothers Order for the Day in The Times of December",1984,"Orwell, George"
1154,3rd 1983 is extremely unsatisfactory and makes references to non-existent,1984,"Orwell, George"
1155,persons. Rewrite it in full and submit your draft to higher authority,1984,"Orwell, George"
1156,before filing.,1984,"Orwell, George"
1157,"Winston read through the offending article. Big Brothers Order for the
Day, it seemed, had been chiefly devoted to praising the work of an
organization known as FFCC, which supplied cigarettes and other comforts
to the sailors in the Floating Fortresses. A certain Comrade Withers, a
prominent member of the Inner Party, had been singled out for special
mention and awarded a decoration, the Order of Conspicuous Merit, Second
Class.

Three months later FFCC had suddenly been dissolved with no reasons given.
One could assume that Withers and his associates were now in disgrace, but
there had been no report of the matter in the Press or on the telescreen.
That was to be expected, since it was unusual for political offenders to
be put on trial or even publicly denounced. The great purges involving
thousands of people, with public trials of traitors and thought-criminals
who made abject confession of their crimes and were afterwards executed,
were special show-pieces not occurring oftener than once in a couple of
years. More commonly, people who had incurred the displeasure of the
Party simply disappeared and were never heard of again. One never had the
smallest clue as to what had happened to them. In some cases they might
not even be dead. Perhaps thirty people personally known to Winston, not
counting his parents, had disappeared at one time or another.

Winston stroked his nose gently with a paper-clip. In the cubicle
across the way Comrade Tillotson was still crouching secretively over
his speakwrite. He raised his head for a moment: again the hostile
spectacle-flash. Winston wondered whether Comrade Tillotson was engaged
on the same job as himself. It was perfectly possible. So tricky a piece
of work would never be entrusted to a single person: on the other hand,
to turn it over to a committee would be to admit openly that an act of
fabrication was taking place. Very likely as many as a dozen people were
now working away on rival versions of what Big Brother had actually said.
And presently some master brain in the Inner Party would select this
version or that, would re-edit it and set in motion the complex processes
of cross-referencing that would be required, and then the chosen lie
would pass into the permanent records and become truth.

Winston did not know why Withers had been disgraced. Perhaps it was for
corruption or incompetence. Perhaps Big Brother was merely getting rid of
a too-popular subordinate. Perhaps Withers or someone close to him had
been suspected of heretical tendencies. Or perhaps--what was likeliest of
all--the thing had simply happened because purges and vaporizations were a
necessary part of the mechanics of government. The only real clue lay in
the words refs unpersons, which indicated that Withers was already dead.
You could not invariably assume this to be the case when people were
arrested. Sometimes they were released and allowed to remain at liberty
for as much as a year or two years before being executed. Very occasionally
some person whom you had believed dead long since would make a ghostly
reappearance at some public trial where he would implicate hundreds of
others by his testimony before vanishing, this time for ever. Withers,
however, was already an UNPERSON. He did not exist: he had never existed.
Winston decided that it would not be enough simply to reverse the tendency
of Big Brothers speech. It was better to make it deal with something",1984,"Orwell, George"
1158,totally unconnected with its original subject.,1984,"Orwell, George"
1159,He might turn the speech into the usual denunciation of traitors and,1984,"Orwell, George"
1160,"thought-criminals, but that was a little too obvious, while to invent a",1984,"Orwell, George"
1161,"victory at the front, or some triumph of over-production in the Ninth",1984,"Orwell, George"
1162,"Three-Year Plan, might complicate the records too much. What was needed",1984,"Orwell, George"
1163,"was a piece of pure fantasy. Suddenly there sprang into his mind, ready",1984,"Orwell, George"
1164,"made as it were, the image of a certain Comrade Ogilvy, who had recently",1984,"Orwell, George"
1165,"died in battle, in heroic circumstances. There were occasions when Big",1984,"Orwell, George"
1166,"Brother devoted his Order for the Day to commemorating some humble,",1984,"Orwell, George"
1167,rank-and-file Party member whose life and death he held up as an example,1984,"Orwell, George"
1168,worthy to be followed. Today he should commemorate Comrade Ogilvy. It was,1984,"Orwell, George"
1169,"true that there was no such person as Comrade Ogilvy, but a few lines of",1984,"Orwell, George"
1170,print and a couple of faked photographs would soon bring him into,1984,"Orwell, George"
1171,existence.,1984,"Orwell, George"
1172,"Winston thought for a moment, then pulled the speakwrite towards him and",1984,"Orwell, George"
1173,"began dictating in Big Brothers familiar style: a style at once military
and pedantic, and, because of a trick of asking questions and then
promptly answering them (What lessons do we learn from this fact,",1984,"Orwell, George"
1174,comrades? The lesson--which is also one of the fundamental principles,1984,"Orwell, George"
1175,"of Ingsoc--that, etc., etc.), easy to imitate.

At the age of three Comrade Ogilvy had refused all toys except a drum, a
sub-machine gun, and a model helicopter. At six--a year early, by a special
relaxation of the rules--he had joined the Spies, at nine he had been a
troop leader. At eleven he had denounced his uncle to the Thought Police
after overhearing a conversation which appeared to him to have criminal
tendencies. At seventeen he had been a district organizer of the Junior
Anti-Sex League. At nineteen he had designed a hand-grenade which had
been adopted by the Ministry of Peace and which, at its first trial, had
killed thirty-one Eurasian prisoners in one burst. At twenty-three he had
perished in action. Pursued by enemy jet planes while flying over the
Indian Ocean with important despatches, he had weighted his body with his
machine gun and leapt out of the helicopter into deep water, despatches
and all--an end, said Big Brother, which it was impossible to contemplate
without feelings of envy. Big Brother added a few remarks on the purity
and single-mindedness of Comrade Ogilvys life. He was a total abstainer",1984,"Orwell, George"
1176,"and a nonsmoker, had no recreations except a daily hour in the gymnasium,",1984,"Orwell, George"
1177,"and had taken a vow of celibacy, believing marriage and the care of a",1984,"Orwell, George"
1178,family to be incompatible with a twenty-four-hour-a-day devotion to duty.,1984,"Orwell, George"
1179,"He had no subjects of conversation except the principles of Ingsoc, and",1984,"Orwell, George"
1180,no aim in life except the defeat of the Eurasian enemy and the hunting-down,1984,"Orwell, George"
1181,"of spies, saboteurs, thought-criminals, and traitors generally.",1984,"Orwell, George"
1182,Winston debated with himself whether to award Comrade Ogilvy the Order of,1984,"Orwell, George"
1183,Conspicuous Merit: in the end he decided against it because of the,1984,"Orwell, George"
1184,unnecessary cross-referencing that it would entail.,1984,"Orwell, George"
1185,Once again he glanced at his rival in the opposite cubicle. Something,1984,"Orwell, George"
1186,seemed to tell him with certainty that Tillotson was busy on the same job,1984,"Orwell, George"
1187,"as himself. There was no way of knowing whose job would finally be adopted,",1984,"Orwell, George"
1188,"but he felt a profound conviction that it would be his own. Comrade Ogilvy,",1984,"Orwell, George"
1189,"unimagined an hour ago, was now a fact. It struck him as curious that you",1984,"Orwell, George"
1190,"could create dead men but not living ones. Comrade Ogilvy, who had never",1984,"Orwell, George"
1191,"existed in the present, now existed in the past, and when once the act of",1984,"Orwell, George"
1192,"forgery was forgotten, he would exist just as authentically, and upon the",1984,"Orwell, George"
1193,"same evidence, as Charlemagne or Julius Caesar.",1984,"Orwell, George"
1194,Chapter 5,1984,"Orwell, George"
1195,"In the low-ceilinged canteen, deep underground, the lunch queue jerked",1984,"Orwell, George"
1196,slowly forward. The room was already very full and deafeningly noisy. From,1984,"Orwell, George"
1197,"the grille at the counter the steam of stew came pouring forth, with a sour",1984,"Orwell, George"
1198,metallic smell which did not quite overcome the fumes of Victory Gin. On,1984,"Orwell, George"
1199,"the far side of the room there was a small bar, a mere hole in the wall,",1984,"Orwell, George"
1200,where gin could be bought at ten cents the large nip.,1984,"Orwell, George"
1201,"Just the man I was looking for, said a voice at Winstons back.

He turned round. It was his friend Syme, who worked in the Research
Department. Perhaps friend was not exactly the right word. You did not
have friends nowadays, you had comrades: but there were some comrades whose
society was pleasanter than that of others. Syme was a philologist, a
specialist in Newspeak. Indeed, he was one of the enormous team of experts
now engaged in compiling the Eleventh Edition of the Newspeak Dictionary.
He was a tiny creature, smaller than Winston, with dark hair and large,
protuberant eyes, at once mournful and derisive, which seemed to search
your face closely while he was speaking to you.

I wanted to ask you whether youd got any razor blades, he said.",1984,"Orwell, George"
1202,Not one! said Winston with a sort of guilty haste. Ive tried all over,1984,"Orwell, George"
1203,the place. They dont exist any longer.,1984,"Orwell, George"
1204,Everyone kept asking you for razor blades. Actually he had two unused ones,1984,"Orwell, George"
1205,which he was hoarding up. There had been a famine of them for months past.,1984,"Orwell, George"
1206,At any given moment there was some necessary article which the Party shops,1984,"Orwell, George"
1207,"were unable to supply. Sometimes it was buttons, sometimes it was darning",1984,"Orwell, George"
1208,"wool, sometimes it was shoelaces; at present it was razor blades. You could",1984,"Orwell, George"
1209,"only get hold of them, if at all, by scrounging more or less furtively on",1984,"Orwell, George"
1210,the free market.,1984,"Orwell, George"
1211,"Ive been using the same blade for six weeks, he added untruthfully.

The queue gave another jerk forward. As they halted he turned and faced
Syme again. Each of them took a greasy metal tray from a pile at the end
of the counter.

Did you go and see the prisoners hanged yesterday? said Syme.

I was working, said Winston indifferently. I shall see it on the",1984,"Orwell, George"
1212,"flicks, I suppose.

A very inadequate substitute, said Syme.

His mocking eyes roved over Winstons face. I know you, the eyes seemed",1984,"Orwell, George"
1213,"to say, I see through you. I know very well why you didnt go to see",1984,"Orwell, George"
1214,"those prisoners hanged. In an intellectual way, Syme was venomously
orthodox. He would talk with a disagreeable gloating satisfaction of
helicopter raids on enemy villages, and trials and confessions of
thought-criminals, the executions in the cellars of the Ministry of Love.
Talking to him was largely a matter of getting him away from such subjects
and entangling him, if possible, in the technicalities of Newspeak, on
which he was authoritative and interesting. Winston turned his head a
little aside to avoid the scrutiny of the large dark eyes.

It was a good hanging, said Syme reminiscently. I think it spoils it",1984,"Orwell, George"
1215,when they tie their feet together. I like to see them kicking. And above,1984,"Orwell, George"
1216,"all, at the end, the tongue sticking right out, and blue--a quite bright",1984,"Orwell, George"
1217,blue. Thats the detail that appeals to me.,1984,"Orwell, George"
1218,"Nex, please! yelled the white-aproned prole with the ladle.

Winston and Syme pushed their trays beneath the grille. On to each was
dumped swiftly the regulation lunch--a metal pannikin of pinkish-grey stew,
a hunk of bread, a cube of cheese, a mug of milkless Victory Coffee, and
one saccharine tablet.

Theres a table over there, under that telescreen, said Syme. Lets pick",1984,"Orwell, George"
1219,"up a gin on the way.

The gin was served out to them in handleless china mugs. They threaded
their way across the crowded room and unpacked their trays on to the
metal-topped table, on one corner of which someone had left a pool of stew,
a filthy liquid mess that had the appearance of vomit. Winston took up his
mug of gin, paused for an instant to collect his nerve, and gulped the
oily-tasting stuff down. When he had winked the tears out of his eyes he
suddenly discovered that he was hungry. He began swallowing spoonfuls of
the stew, which, in among its general sloppiness, had cubes of spongy
pinkish stuff which was probably a preparation of meat. Neither of them
spoke again till they had emptied their pannikins. From the table at
Winstons left, a little behind his back, someone was talking rapidly and",1984,"Orwell, George"
1220,"continuously, a harsh gabble almost like the quacking of a duck, which",1984,"Orwell, George"
1221,pierced the general uproar of the room.,1984,"Orwell, George"
1222,"How is the Dictionary getting on? said Winston, raising his voice to",1984,"Orwell, George"
1223,overcome the noise.,1984,"Orwell, George"
1224,"Slowly, said Syme. Im on the adjectives. Its fascinating.",1984,"Orwell, George"
1225,He had brightened up immediately at the mention of Newspeak. He pushed his,1984,"Orwell, George"
1226,"pannikin aside, took up his hunk of bread in one delicate hand and his",1984,"Orwell, George"
1227,"cheese in the other, and leaned across the table so as to be able to speak",1984,"Orwell, George"
1228,without shouting.,1984,"Orwell, George"
1229,"The Eleventh Edition is the definitive edition, he said. Were getting",1984,"Orwell, George"
1230,"the language into its final shape--the shape its going to have when nobody
speaks anything else. When weve finished with it, people like you will",1984,"Orwell, George"
1231,"have to learn it all over again. You think, I dare say, that our chief job",1984,"Orwell, George"
1232,"is inventing new words. But not a bit of it! Were destroying words--scores
of them, hundreds of them, every day. Were cutting the language down to",1984,"Orwell, George"
1233,"the bone. The Eleventh Edition wont contain a single word that will become
obsolete before the year 2050.",1984,"Orwell, George"
1234,"He bit hungrily into his bread and swallowed a couple of mouthfuls, then",1984,"Orwell, George"
1235,"continued speaking, with a sort of pedants passion. His thin dark face
had become animated, his eyes had lost their mocking expression and grown
almost dreamy.

Its a beautiful thing, the destruction of words. Of course the great
wastage is in the verbs and adjectives, but there are hundreds of nouns
that can be got rid of as well. It isnt only the synonyms; there are also",1984,"Orwell, George"
1236,"the antonyms. After all, what justification is there for a word which is",1984,"Orwell, George"
1237,simply the opposite of some other word? A word contains its opposite in,1984,"Orwell, George"
1238,"itself. Take good, for instance. If you have a word like good, what",1984,"Orwell, George"
1239,"need is there for a word like bad? Ungood will do just as well--better,",1984,"Orwell, George"
1240,"because its an exact opposite, which the other is not. Or again, if you
want a stronger version of ""good"", what sense is there in having a whole
string of vague useless words like ""excellent"" and ""splendid"" and all the
rest of them? ""Plusgood"" covers the meaning, or ""doubleplusgood"" if you
want something stronger still. Of course we use those forms already. but
in the final version of Newspeak therell be nothing else. In the end the",1984,"Orwell, George"
1241,whole notion of goodness and badness will be covered by only six words--in,1984,"Orwell, George"
1242,"reality, only one word. Dont you see the beauty of that, Winston? It was
B.B.s idea originally, of course, he added as an afterthought.

A sort of vapid eagerness flitted across Winstons face at the mention of",1984,"Orwell, George"
1243,Big Brother. Nevertheless Syme immediately detected a certain lack of,1984,"Orwell, George"
1244,enthusiasm.,1984,"Orwell, George"
1245,"You havent a real appreciation of Newspeak, Winston, he said almost
sadly. Even when you write it youre still thinking in Oldspeak. Ive read",1984,"Orwell, George"
1246,"some of those pieces that you write in The Times occasionally. Theyre
good enough, but theyre translations. In your heart youd prefer to stick
to Oldspeak, with all its vagueness and its useless shades of meaning.
You dont grasp the beauty of the destruction of words. Do you know that",1984,"Orwell, George"
1247,Newspeak is the only language in the world whose vocabulary gets smaller,1984,"Orwell, George"
1248,"every year?

Winston did know that, of course. He smiled, sympathetically he hoped, not
trusting himself to speak. Syme bit off another fragment of the
dark-coloured bread, chewed it briefly, and went on:

Dont you see that the whole aim of Newspeak is to narrow the range of
thought? In the end we shall make thoughtcrime literally impossible,
because there will be no words in which to express it. Every concept that
can ever be needed, will be expressed by exactly one word, with its meaning
rigidly defined and all its subsidiary meanings rubbed out and forgotten.
Already, in the Eleventh Edition, were not far from that point. But the",1984,"Orwell, George"
1249,process will still be continuing long after you and I are dead. Every year,1984,"Orwell, George"
1250,"fewer and fewer words, and the range of consciousness always a little",1984,"Orwell, George"
1251,"smaller. Even now, of course, theres no reason or excuse for committing
thoughtcrime. Its merely a question of self-discipline, reality-control.",1984,"Orwell, George"
1252,"But in the end there wont be any need even for that. The Revolution will
be complete when the language is perfect. Newspeak is Ingsoc and Ingsoc
is Newspeak, he added with a sort of mystical satisfaction. Has it ever
occurred to you, Winston, that by the year 2050, at the very latest, not a
single human being will be alive who could understand such a conversation
as we are having now?",1984,"Orwell, George"
1253,"Except---- began Winston doubtfully, and he stopped.",1984,"Orwell, George"
1254,"It had been on the tip of his tongue to say Except the proles, but he",1984,"Orwell, George"
1255,"checked himself, not feeling fully certain that this remark was not in",1984,"Orwell, George"
1256,"some way unorthodox. Syme, however, had divined what he was about to say.",1984,"Orwell, George"
1257,"The proles are not human beings, he said carelessly. By 2050--earlier,
probably--all real knowledge of Oldspeak will have disappeared. The whole
literature of the past will have been destroyed. Chaucer, Shakespeare,
Milton, Byron--theyll exist only in Newspeak versions, not merely changed",1984,"Orwell, George"
1258,"into something different, but actually changed into something contradictory",1984,"Orwell, George"
1259,of what they used to be. Even the literature of the Party will change.,1984,"Orwell, George"
1260,"Even the slogans will change. How could you have a slogan like freedom is
slavery when the concept of freedom has been abolished? The whole climate",1984,"Orwell, George"
1261,"of thought will be different. In fact there will be no thought, as we",1984,"Orwell, George"
1262,understand it now. Orthodoxy means not thinking--not needing to think.,1984,"Orwell, George"
1263,"Orthodoxy is unconsciousness.

One of these days, thought Winston with sudden deep conviction, Syme will
be vaporized. He is too intelligent. He sees too clearly and speaks too
plainly. The Party does not like such people. One day he will disappear.
It is written in his face.

Winston had finished his bread and cheese. He turned a little sideways
in his chair to drink his mug of coffee. At the table on his left the man
with the strident voice was still talking remorselessly away. A young
woman who was perhaps his secretary, and who was sitting with her back
to Winston, was listening to him and seemed to be eagerly agreeing with
everything that he said. From time to time Winston caught some such remark
as I think youre so right, I do so agree with you, uttered in a youthful",1984,"Orwell, George"
1264,and rather silly feminine voice. But the other voice never stopped for an,1984,"Orwell, George"
1265,"instant, even when the girl was speaking. Winston knew the man by sight,",1984,"Orwell, George"
1266,though he knew no more about him than that he held some important post,1984,"Orwell, George"
1267,"in the Fiction Department. He was a man of about thirty, with a muscular",1984,"Orwell, George"
1268,"throat and a large, mobile mouth. His head was thrown back a little, and",1984,"Orwell, George"
1269,"because of the angle at which he was sitting, his spectacles caught the",1984,"Orwell, George"
1270,light and presented to Winston two blank discs instead of eyes. What was,1984,"Orwell, George"
1271,"slightly horrible, was that from the stream of sound that poured out of",1984,"Orwell, George"
1272,his mouth it was almost impossible to distinguish a single word. Just,1984,"Orwell, George"
1273,"once Winston caught a phrase--complete and final elimination of
Goldsteinism--jerked out very rapidly and, as it seemed, all in one piece,",1984,"Orwell, George"
1274,"like a line of type cast solid. For the rest it was just a noise, a",1984,"Orwell, George"
1275,"quack-quack-quacking. And yet, though you could not actually hear what the",1984,"Orwell, George"
1276,"man was saying, you could not be in any doubt about its general nature.",1984,"Orwell, George"
1277,He might be denouncing Goldstein and demanding sterner measures against,1984,"Orwell, George"
1278,"thought-criminals and saboteurs, he might be fulminating against the",1984,"Orwell, George"
1279,"atrocities of the Eurasian army, he might be praising Big Brother or the",1984,"Orwell, George"
1280,"heroes on the Malabar front--it made no difference. Whatever it was, you",1984,"Orwell, George"
1281,"could be certain that every word of it was pure orthodoxy, pure Ingsoc.",1984,"Orwell, George"
1282,"As he watched the eyeless face with the jaw moving rapidly up and down,",1984,"Orwell, George"
1283,Winston had a curious feeling that this was not a real human being but,1984,"Orwell, George"
1284,"some kind of dummy. It was not the mans brain that was speaking, it was
his larynx. The stuff that was coming out of him consisted of words, but
it was not speech in the true sense: it was a noise uttered in
unconsciousness, like the quacking of a duck.

Syme had fallen silent for a moment, and with the handle of his spoon was
tracing patterns in the puddle of stew. The voice from the other table
quacked rapidly on, easily audible in spite of the surrounding din.

There is a word in Newspeak, said Syme, I dont know whether you know
it: DUCKSPEAK, to quack like a duck. It is one of those interesting words
that have two contradictory meanings. Applied to an opponent, it is abuse,
applied to someone you agree with, it is praise.",1984,"Orwell, George"
1285,"Unquestionably Syme will be vaporized, Winston thought again. He thought",1984,"Orwell, George"
1286,"it with a kind of sadness, although well knowing that Syme despised him",1984,"Orwell, George"
1287,"and slightly disliked him, and was fully capable of denouncing him as a",1984,"Orwell, George"
1288,thought-criminal if he saw any reason for doing so. There was something,1984,"Orwell, George"
1289,"subtly wrong with Syme. There was something that he lacked: discretion,",1984,"Orwell, George"
1290,"aloofness, a sort of saving stupidity. You could not say that he was",1984,"Orwell, George"
1291,"unorthodox. He believed in the principles of Ingsoc, he venerated Big",1984,"Orwell, George"
1292,"Brother, he rejoiced over victories, he hated heretics, not merely with",1984,"Orwell, George"
1293,"sincerity but with a sort of restless zeal, an up-to-dateness of",1984,"Orwell, George"
1294,"information, which the ordinary Party member did not approach. Yet a faint",1984,"Orwell, George"
1295,air of disreputability always clung to him. He said things that would have,1984,"Orwell, George"
1296,"been better unsaid, he had read too many books, he frequented the Chestnut",1984,"Orwell, George"
1297,"Tree Cafe, haunt of painters and musicians. There was no law, not even an",1984,"Orwell, George"
1298,"unwritten law, against frequenting the Chestnut Tree Cafe, yet the place",1984,"Orwell, George"
1299,"was somehow ill-omened. The old, discredited leaders of the Party had been",1984,"Orwell, George"
1300,"used to gather there before they were finally purged. Goldstein himself,",1984,"Orwell, George"
1301,"it was said, had sometimes been seen there, years and decades ago. Symes
fate was not difficult to foresee. And yet it was a fact that if Syme
grasped, even for three seconds, the nature of his, Winstons, secret",1984,"Orwell, George"
1302,"opinions, he would betray him instantly to the Thought Police. So would",1984,"Orwell, George"
1303,"anybody else, for that matter: but Syme more than most. Zeal was not",1984,"Orwell, George"
1304,enough. Orthodoxy was unconsciousness.,1984,"Orwell, George"
1305,"Syme looked up. Here comes Parsons, he said.",1984,"Orwell, George"
1306,"Something in the tone of his voice seemed to add, that bloody fool.",1984,"Orwell, George"
1307,"Parsons, Winstons fellow-tenant at Victory Mansions, was in fact threading
his way across the room--a tubby, middle-sized man with fair hair and a
froglike face. At thirty-five he was already putting on rolls of fat at
neck and waistline, but his movements were brisk and boyish. His whole
appearance was that of a little boy grown large, so much so that although
he was wearing the regulation overalls, it was almost impossible not to
think of him as being dressed in the blue shorts, grey shirt, and red
neckerchief of the Spies. In visualizing him one saw always a picture of
dimpled knees and sleeves rolled back from pudgy forearms. Parsons did,
indeed, invariably revert to shorts when a community hike or any other
physical activity gave him an excuse for doing so. He greeted them both
with a cheery Hullo, hullo! and sat down at the table, giving off an
intense smell of sweat. Beads of moisture stood out all over his pink face.
His powers of sweating were extraordinary. At the Community Centre you
could always tell when he had been playing table-tennis by the dampness of
the bat handle. Syme had produced a strip of paper on which there was a
long column of words, and was studying it with an ink-pencil between his
fingers.

Look at him working away in the lunch hour, said Parsons, nudging
Winston. Keenness, eh? Whats that youve got there, old boy? Something",1984,"Orwell, George"
1308,"a bit too brainy for me, I expect. Smith, old boy, Ill tell you why Im",1984,"Orwell, George"
1309,chasing you. Its that sub you forgot to give me.,1984,"Orwell, George"
1310,"Which sub is that? said Winston, automatically feeling for money. About",1984,"Orwell, George"
1311,"a quarter of ones salary had to be earmarked for voluntary subscriptions,
which were so numerous that it was difficult to keep track of them.

For Hate Week. You know--the house-by-house fund. Im treasurer for our
block. Were making an all-out effort--going to put on a tremendous show.",1984,"Orwell, George"
1312,"I tell you, it wont be my fault if old Victory Mansions doesnt have the",1984,"Orwell, George"
1313,"biggest outfit of flags in the whole street. Two dollars you promised me.

Winston found and handed over two creased and filthy notes, which Parsons
entered in a small notebook, in the neat handwriting of the illiterate.

By the way, old boy, he said. I hear that little beggar of mine let fly",1984,"Orwell, George"
1314,at you with his catapult yesterday. I gave him a good dressing-down for it.,1984,"Orwell, George"
1315,In fact I told him Id take the catapult away if he does it again.,1984,"Orwell, George"
1316,"I think he was a little upset at not going to the execution, said",1984,"Orwell, George"
1317,Winston.,1984,"Orwell, George"
1318,"Ah, well--what I mean to say, shows the right spirit, doesnt it?",1984,"Orwell, George"
1319,"Mischievous little beggars they are, both of them, but talk about keenness!",1984,"Orwell, George"
1320,"All they think about is the Spies, and the war, of course. Dyou know what
that little girl of mine did last Saturday, when her troop was on a hike
out Berkhamsted way? She got two other girls to go with her, slipped off
from the hike, and spent the whole afternoon following a strange man. They
kept on his tail for two hours, right through the woods, and then, when
they got into Amersham, handed him over to the patrols.",1984,"Orwell, George"
1321,"What did they do that for? said Winston, somewhat taken aback. Parsons",1984,"Orwell, George"
1322,went on triumphantly:,1984,"Orwell, George"
1323,"My kid made sure he was some kind of enemy agent--might have been dropped
by parachute, for instance. But heres the point, old boy. What do you",1984,"Orwell, George"
1324,think put her on to him in the first place? She spotted he was wearing a,1984,"Orwell, George"
1325,"funny kind of shoes--said shed never seen anyone wearing shoes like that
before. So the chances were he was a foreigner. Pretty smart for a nipper
of seven, eh?",1984,"Orwell, George"
1326,What happened to the man? said Winston.,1984,"Orwell, George"
1327,"Ah, that I couldnt say, of course. But I wouldnt be altogether surprised
if---- Parsons made the motion of aiming a rifle, and clicked his tongue",1984,"Orwell, George"
1328,for the explosion.,1984,"Orwell, George"
1329,"Good, said Syme abstractedly, without looking up from his strip of paper.",1984,"Orwell, George"
1330,"Of course we cant afford to take chances, agreed Winston dutifully.

What I mean to say, there is a war on, said Parsons.

As though in confirmation of this, a trumpet call floated from the
telescreen just above their heads. However, it was not the proclamation of
a military victory this time, but merely an announcement from the Ministry
of Plenty.

Comrades! cried an eager youthful voice. Attention, comrades! We have",1984,"Orwell, George"
1331,glorious news for you. We have won the battle for production! Returns now,1984,"Orwell, George"
1332,completed of the output of all classes of consumption goods show that the,1984,"Orwell, George"
1333,standard of living has risen by no less than 20 per cent over the past,1984,"Orwell, George"
1334,year. All over Oceania this morning there were irrepressible spontaneous,1984,"Orwell, George"
1335,demonstrations when workers marched out of factories and offices and,1984,"Orwell, George"
1336,paraded through the streets with banners voicing their gratitude to Big,1984,"Orwell, George"
1337,"Brother for the new, happy life which his wise leadership has bestowed",1984,"Orwell, George"
1338,"upon us. Here are some of the completed figures. Foodstuffs----

The phrase our new, happy life recurred several times. It had been a
favourite of late with the Ministry of Plenty. Parsons, his attention
caught by the trumpet call, sat listening with a sort of gaping solemnity,
a sort of edified boredom. He could not follow the figures, but he was
aware that they were in some way a cause for satisfaction. He had lugged
out a huge and filthy pipe which was already half full of charred tobacco.
With the tobacco ration at 100 grammes a week it was seldom possible to
fill a pipe to the top. Winston was smoking a Victory Cigarette which he
held carefully horizontal. The new ration did not start till tomorrow and
he had only four cigarettes left. For the moment he had shut his ears to
the remoter noises and was listening to the stuff that streamed out of the
telescreen. It appeared that there had even been demonstrations to thank
Big Brother for raising the chocolate ration to twenty grammes a week. And
only yesterday, he reflected, it had been announced that the ration was
to be REDUCED to twenty grammes a week. Was it possible that they could
swallow that, after only twenty-four hours? Yes, they swallowed it. Parsons
swallowed it easily, with the stupidity of an animal. The eyeless creature
at the other table swallowed it fanatically, passionately, with a furious
desire to track down, denounce, and vaporize anyone who should suggest that
last week the ration had been thirty grammes. Syme, too--in some more
complex way, involving doublethink, Syme swallowed it. Was he, then, ALONE
in the possession of a memory?

The fabulous statistics continued to pour out of the telescreen. As
compared with last year there was more food, more clothes, more houses,
more furniture, more cooking-pots, more fuel, more ships, more helicopters,
more books, more babies--more of everything except disease, crime, and
insanity. Year by year and minute by minute, everybody and everything was
whizzing rapidly upwards. As Syme had done earlier Winston had taken up
his spoon and was dabbling in the pale-coloured gravy that dribbled across
the table, drawing a long streak of it out into a pattern. He meditated
resentfully on the physical texture of life. Had it always been like
this? Had food always tasted like this? He looked round the canteen.
A low-ceilinged, crowded room, its walls grimy from the contact of
innumerable bodies; battered metal tables and chairs, placed so close
together that you sat with elbows touching; bent spoons, dented trays,
coarse white mugs; all surfaces greasy, grime in every crack; and a
sourish, composite smell of bad gin and bad coffee and metallic stew and
dirty clothes. Always in your stomach and in your skin there was a sort
of protest, a feeling that you had been cheated of something that you had
a right to. It was true that he had no memories of anything greatly
different. In any time that he could accurately remember, there had never
been quite enough to eat, one had never had socks or underclothes that
were not full of holes, furniture had always been battered and rickety,
rooms underheated, tube trains crowded, houses falling to pieces,
bread dark-coloured, tea a rarity, coffee filthy-tasting, cigarettes
insufficient--nothing cheap and plentiful except synthetic gin. And though,
of course, it grew worse as ones body aged, was it not a sign that this",1984,"Orwell, George"
1339,"was NOT the natural order of things, if ones heart sickened at the
discomfort and dirt and scarcity, the interminable winters, the stickiness
of ones socks, the lifts that never worked, the cold water, the gritty",1984,"Orwell, George"
1340,"soap, the cigarettes that came to pieces, the food with its strange evil",1984,"Orwell, George"
1341,tastes? Why should one feel it to be intolerable unless one had some kind,1984,"Orwell, George"
1342,of ancestral memory that things had once been different?,1984,"Orwell, George"
1343,"He looked round the canteen again. Nearly everyone was ugly, and would",1984,"Orwell, George"
1344,still have been ugly even if dressed otherwise than in the uniform blue,1984,"Orwell, George"
1345,"overalls. On the far side of the room, sitting at a table alone, a small,",1984,"Orwell, George"
1346,"curiously beetle-like man was drinking a cup of coffee, his little eyes",1984,"Orwell, George"
1347,"darting suspicious glances from side to side. How easy it was, thought",1984,"Orwell, George"
1348,"Winston, if you did not look about you, to believe that the physical type",1984,"Orwell, George"
1349,set up by the Party as an ideal--tall muscular youths and deep-bosomed,1984,"Orwell, George"
1350,"maidens, blond-haired, vital, sunburnt, carefree--existed and even",1984,"Orwell, George"
1351,"predominated. Actually, so far as he could judge, the majority of people",1984,"Orwell, George"
1352,"in Airstrip One were small, dark, and ill-favoured. It was curious how that",1984,"Orwell, George"
1353,"beetle-like type proliferated in the Ministries: little dumpy men, growing",1984,"Orwell, George"
1354,"stout very early in life, with short legs, swift scuttling movements, and",1984,"Orwell, George"
1355,fat inscrutable faces with very small eyes. It was the type that seemed to,1984,"Orwell, George"
1356,flourish best under the dominion of the Party.,1984,"Orwell, George"
1357,The announcement from the Ministry of Plenty ended on another trumpet call,1984,"Orwell, George"
1358,"and gave way to tinny music. Parsons, stirred to vague enthusiasm by the",1984,"Orwell, George"
1359,"bombardment of figures, took his pipe out of his mouth.",1984,"Orwell, George"
1360,"The Ministry of Plentys certainly done a good job this year, he said
with a knowing shake of his head. By the way, Smith old boy, I suppose",1984,"Orwell, George"
1361,you havent got any razor blades you can let me have?,1984,"Orwell, George"
1362,"Not one, said Winston. Ive been using the same blade for six weeks",1984,"Orwell, George"
1363,"myself.

Ah, well--just thought Id ask you, old boy.",1984,"Orwell, George"
1364,"Sorry, said Winston.",1984,"Orwell, George"
1365,"The quacking voice from the next table, temporarily silenced during the",1984,"Orwell, George"
1366,"Ministrys announcement, had started up again, as loud as ever. For some
reason Winston suddenly found himself thinking of Mrs Parsons, with her
wispy hair and the dust in the creases of her face. Within two years those
children would be denouncing her to the Thought Police. Mrs Parsons would
be vaporized. Syme would be vaporized. Winston would be vaporized. OBrien",1984,"Orwell, George"
1367,"would be vaporized. Parsons, on the other hand, would never be vaporized.",1984,"Orwell, George"
1368,The eyeless creature with the quacking voice would never be vaporized.,1984,"Orwell, George"
1369,The little beetle-like men who scuttle so nimbly through the labyrinthine,1984,"Orwell, George"
1370,"corridors of Ministries they, too, would never be vaporized. And the girl",1984,"Orwell, George"
1371,"with dark hair, the girl from the Fiction Department--she would never be",1984,"Orwell, George"
1372,vaporized either. It seemed to him that he knew instinctively who would,1984,"Orwell, George"
1373,survive and who would perish: though just what it was that made for,1984,"Orwell, George"
1374,"survival, it was not easy to say.",1984,"Orwell, George"
1375,At this moment he was dragged out of his reverie with a violent jerk. The,1984,"Orwell, George"
1376,girl at the next table had turned partly round and was looking at him. It,1984,"Orwell, George"
1377,"was the girl with dark hair. She was looking at him in a sidelong way, but",1984,"Orwell, George"
1378,with curious intensity. The instant she caught his eye she looked away,1984,"Orwell, George"
1379,again.,1984,"Orwell, George"
1380,"The sweat started out on Winstons backbone. A horrible pang of terror
went through him. It was gone almost at once, but it left a sort of nagging
uneasiness behind. Why was she watching him? Why did she keep following him
about? Unfortunately he could not remember whether she had already been at
the table when he arrived, or had come there afterwards. But yesterday, at
any rate, during the Two Minutes Hate, she had sat immediately behind him
when there was no apparent need to do so. Quite likely her real object had
been to listen to him and make sure whether he was shouting loudly enough.

His earlier thought returned to him: probably she was not actually a member
of the Thought Police, but then it was precisely the amateur spy who was
the greatest danger of all. He did not know how long she had been looking
at him, but perhaps for as much as five minutes, and it was possible
that his features had not been perfectly under control. It was terribly
dangerous to let your thoughts wander when you were in any public place
or within range of a telescreen. The smallest thing could give you away.
A nervous tic, an unconscious look of anxiety, a habit of muttering to
yourself--anything that carried with it the suggestion of abnormality, of
having something to hide. In any case, to wear an improper expression on
your face (to look incredulous when a victory was announced, for example)
was itself a punishable offence. There was even a word for it in Newspeak:
FACECRIME, it was called.

The girl had turned her back on him again. Perhaps after all she was not
really following him about, perhaps it was coincidence that she had sat so
close to him two days running. His cigarette had gone out, and he laid it
carefully on the edge of the table. He would finish smoking it after work,
if he could keep the tobacco in it. Quite likely the person at the next
table was a spy of the Thought Police, and quite likely he would be in the
cellars of the Ministry of Love within three days, but a cigarette end
must not be wasted. Syme had folded up his strip of paper and stowed it
away in his pocket. Parsons had begun talking again.

Did I ever tell you, old boy, he said, chuckling round the stem of his
pipe, about the time when those two nippers of mine set fire to the old",1984,"Orwell, George"
1381,"market-womans skirt because they saw her wrapping up sausages in a poster
of B.B.? Sneaked up behind her and set fire to it with a box of matches.
Burned her quite badly, I believe. Little beggars, eh? But keen as mustard!
Thats a first-rate training they give them in the Spies nowadays--better",1984,"Orwell, George"
1382,"than in my day, even. What dyou thinks the latest thing theyve served
them out with? Ear trumpets for listening through keyholes! My little
girl brought one home the other night--tried it out on our sitting-room
door, and reckoned she could hear twice as much as with her ear to the
hole. Of course its only a toy, mind you. Still, gives em the right
idea, eh?",1984,"Orwell, George"
1383,At this moment the telescreen let out a piercing whistle. It was the,1984,"Orwell, George"
1384,signal to return to work. All three men sprang to their feet to join in,1984,"Orwell, George"
1385,"the struggle round the lifts, and the remaining tobacco fell out of",1984,"Orwell, George"
1386,"Winstons cigarette.




Chapter 6



Winston was writing in his diary:


   It was three years ago. It was on a dark evening, in a narrow
side-street near one of the big railway stations. She was standing near a
doorway in the wall, under a street lamp that hardly gave any light. She
had a young face, painted very thick. It was really the paint that appealed
to me, the whiteness of it, like a mask, and the bright red lips. Party
women never paint their faces. There was nobody else in the street, and no
telescreens. She said two dollars. I----


For the moment it was too difficult to go on. He shut his eyes and pressed
his fingers against them, trying to squeeze out the vision that kept
recurring. He had an almost overwhelming temptation to shout a string of
filthy words at the top of his voice. Or to bang his head against the wall,
to kick over the table, and hurl the inkpot through the window--to do any
violent or noisy or painful thing that might black out the memory that was
tormenting him.

Your worst enemy, he reflected, was your own nervous system. At any moment
the tension inside you was liable to translate itself into some visible
symptom. He thought of a man whom he had passed in the street a few weeks
back; a quite ordinary-looking man, a Party member, aged thirty-five to
forty, tallish and thin, carrying a brief-case. They were a few metres
apart when the left side of the mans face was suddenly contorted by a sort",1984,"Orwell, George"
1387,of spasm. It happened again just as they were passing one another: it was,1984,"Orwell, George"
1388,"only a twitch, a quiver, rapid as the clicking of a camera shutter, but",1984,"Orwell, George"
1389,obviously habitual. He remembered thinking at the time: That poor devil is,1984,"Orwell, George"
1390,done for. And what was frightening was that the action was quite possibly,1984,"Orwell, George"
1391,unconscious. The most deadly danger of all was talking in your sleep. There,1984,"Orwell, George"
1392,"was no way of guarding against that, so far as he could see.",1984,"Orwell, George"
1393,He drew his breath and went on writing:,1984,"Orwell, George"
1394,   I went with her through the doorway and across a backyard into a,1984,"Orwell, George"
1395,"basement kitchen. There was a bed against the wall, and a lamp on the",1984,"Orwell, George"
1396,"table, turned down very low. She----",1984,"Orwell, George"
1397,His teeth were set on edge. He would have liked to spit. Simultaneously,1984,"Orwell, George"
1398,"with the woman in the basement kitchen he thought of Katharine, his wife.",1984,"Orwell, George"
1399,"Winston was married--had been married, at any rate: probably he still was",1984,"Orwell, George"
1400,"married, so far as he knew his wife was not dead. He seemed to breathe",1984,"Orwell, George"
1401,"again the warm stuffy odour of the basement kitchen, an odour compounded",1984,"Orwell, George"
1402,"of bugs and dirty clothes and villainous cheap scent, but nevertheless",1984,"Orwell, George"
1403,"alluring, because no woman of the Party ever used scent, or could be",1984,"Orwell, George"
1404,imagined as doing so. Only the proles used scent. In his mind the smell,1984,"Orwell, George"
1405,of it was inextricably mixed up with fornication.,1984,"Orwell, George"
1406,When he had gone with that woman it had been his first lapse in two years,1984,"Orwell, George"
1407,"or thereabouts. Consorting with prostitutes was forbidden, of course, but",1984,"Orwell, George"
1408,it was one of those rules that you could occasionally nerve yourself to,1984,"Orwell, George"
1409,"break. It was dangerous, but it was not a life-and-death matter. To be",1984,"Orwell, George"
1410,caught with a prostitute might mean five years in a forced-labour camp:,1984,"Orwell, George"
1411,"not more, if you had committed no other offence. And it was easy enough,",1984,"Orwell, George"
1412,provided that you could avoid being caught in the act. The poorer quarters,1984,"Orwell, George"
1413,swarmed with women who were ready to sell themselves. Some could even be,1984,"Orwell, George"
1414,"purchased for a bottle of gin, which the proles were not supposed to drink.",1984,"Orwell, George"
1415,"Tacitly the Party was even inclined to encourage prostitution, as an outlet",1984,"Orwell, George"
1416,for instincts which could not be altogether suppressed. Mere debauchery,1984,"Orwell, George"
1417,"did not matter very much, so long as it was furtive and joyless and only",1984,"Orwell, George"
1418,involved the women of a submerged and despised class. The unforgivable,1984,"Orwell, George"
1419,crime was promiscuity between Party members. But--though this was one,1984,"Orwell, George"
1420,of the crimes that the accused in the great purges invariably confessed,1984,"Orwell, George"
1421,to--it was difficult to imagine any such thing actually happening.,1984,"Orwell, George"
1422,The aim of the Party was not merely to prevent men and women from forming,1984,"Orwell, George"
1423,"loyalties which it might not be able to control. Its real, undeclared",1984,"Orwell, George"
1424,purpose was to remove all pleasure from the sexual act. Not love so much,1984,"Orwell, George"
1425,"as eroticism was the enemy, inside marriage as well as outside it. All",1984,"Orwell, George"
1426,marriages between Party members had to be approved by a committee,1984,"Orwell, George"
1427,"appointed for the purpose, and--though the principle was never clearly",1984,"Orwell, George"
1428,stated--permission was always refused if the couple concerned gave,1984,"Orwell, George"
1429,the impression of being physically attracted to one another. The only,1984,"Orwell, George"
1430,recognized purpose of marriage was to beget children for the service of,1984,"Orwell, George"
1431,the Party. Sexual intercourse was to be looked on as a slightly disgusting,1984,"Orwell, George"
1432,"minor operation, like having an enema. This again was never put into plain",1984,"Orwell, George"
1433,"words, but in an indirect way it was rubbed into every Party member from",1984,"Orwell, George"
1434,childhood onwards. There were even organizations such as the Junior,1984,"Orwell, George"
1435,"Anti-Sex League, which advocated complete celibacy for both sexes. All",1984,"Orwell, George"
1436,"children were to be begotten by artificial insemination (ARTSEM, it was",1984,"Orwell, George"
1437,"called in Newspeak) and brought up in public institutions. This, Winston",1984,"Orwell, George"
1438,"was aware, was not meant altogether seriously, but somehow it fitted in",1984,"Orwell, George"
1439,with the general ideology of the Party. The Party was trying to kill the,1984,"Orwell, George"
1440,"sex instinct, or, if it could not be killed, then to distort it and dirty",1984,"Orwell, George"
1441,"it. He did not know why this was so, but it seemed natural that it should",1984,"Orwell, George"
1442,"be so. And as far as the women were concerned, the Partys efforts were
largely successful.

He thought again of Katharine. It must be nine, ten--nearly eleven years
since they had parted. It was curious how seldom he thought of her. For
days at a time he was capable of forgetting that he had ever been married.
They had only been together for about fifteen months. The Party did not
permit divorce, but it rather encouraged separation in cases where there
were no children.

Katharine was a tall, fair-haired girl, very straight, with splendid
movements. She had a bold, aquiline face, a face that one might have called
noble until one discovered that there was as nearly as possible nothing
behind it. Very early in her married life he had decided--though perhaps
it was only that he knew her more intimately than he knew most people--that
she had without exception the most stupid, vulgar, empty mind that he had
ever encountered. She had not a thought in her head that was not a slogan,
and there was no imbecility, absolutely none that she was not capable of
swallowing if the Party handed it out to her. The human sound-track he
nicknamed her in his own mind. Yet he could have endured living with her
if it had not been for just one thing--sex.

As soon as he touched her she seemed to wince and stiffen. To embrace her
was like embracing a jointed wooden image. And what was strange was that
even when she was clasping him against her he had the feeling that she
was simultaneously pushing him away with all her strength. The rigidity
of her muscles managed to convey that impression. She would lie there
with shut eyes, neither resisting nor co-operating but SUBMITTING. It was
extraordinarily embarrassing, and, after a while, horrible. But even then
he could have borne living with her if it had been agreed that they should
remain celibate. But curiously enough it was Katharine who refused this.
They must, she said, produce a child if they could. So the performance
continued to happen, once a week quite regularly, whenever it was not
impossible. She even used to remind him of it in the morning, as something
which had to be done that evening and which must not be forgotten. She had
two names for it. One was making a baby, and the other was our duty to",1984,"Orwell, George"
1443,"the Party (yes, she had actually used that phrase). Quite soon he grew to
have a feeling of positive dread when the appointed day came round. But
luckily no child appeared, and in the end she agreed to give up trying,
and soon afterwards they parted.

Winston sighed inaudibly. He picked up his pen again and
wrote:


   She threw herself down on the bed, and at once, without any kind of
preliminary in the most coarse, horrible way you can imagine, pulled up
her skirt. I----


He saw himself standing there in the dim lamplight, with the smell of bugs
and cheap scent in his nostrils, and in his heart a feeling of defeat and
resentment which even at that moment was mixed up with the thought of
Katharines white body, frozen for ever by the hypnotic power of the Party.",1984,"Orwell, George"
1444,Why did it always have to be like this? Why could he not have a woman of,1984,"Orwell, George"
1445,his own instead of these filthy scuffles at intervals of years? But a real,1984,"Orwell, George"
1446,love affair was an almost unthinkable event. The women of the Party were,1984,"Orwell, George"
1447,all alike. Chastity was as deep ingrained in them as Party loyalty. By,1984,"Orwell, George"
1448,"careful early conditioning, by games and cold water, by the rubbish that",1984,"Orwell, George"
1449,"was dinned into them at school and in the Spies and the Youth League, by",1984,"Orwell, George"
1450,"lectures, parades, songs, slogans, and martial music, the natural feeling",1984,"Orwell, George"
1451,had been driven out of them. His reason told him that there must be,1984,"Orwell, George"
1452,"exceptions, but his heart did not believe it. They were all impregnable,",1984,"Orwell, George"
1453,"as the Party intended that they should be. And what he wanted, more even",1984,"Orwell, George"
1454,"than to be loved, was to break down that wall of virtue, even if it were",1984,"Orwell, George"
1455,"only once in his whole life. The sexual act, successfully performed, was",1984,"Orwell, George"
1456,"rebellion. Desire was thoughtcrime. Even to have awakened Katharine, if he",1984,"Orwell, George"
1457,"could have achieved it, would have been like a seduction, although she was",1984,"Orwell, George"
1458,his wife.,1984,"Orwell, George"
1459,But the rest of the story had got to be written down. He wrote:,1984,"Orwell, George"
1460,   I turned up the lamp. When I saw her in the light----,1984,"Orwell, George"
1461,After the darkness the feeble light of the paraffin lamp had seemed very,1984,"Orwell, George"
1462,bright. For the first time he could see the woman properly. He had taken a,1984,"Orwell, George"
1463,"step towards her and then halted, full of lust and terror. He was painfully",1984,"Orwell, George"
1464,conscious of the risk he had taken in coming here. It was perfectly,1984,"Orwell, George"
1465,possible that the patrols would catch him on the way out: for that matter,1984,"Orwell, George"
1466,they might be waiting outside the door at this moment. If he went away,1984,"Orwell, George"
1467,without even doing what he had come here to do----!,1984,"Orwell, George"
1468,"It had got to be written down, it had got to be confessed. What he had",1984,"Orwell, George"
1469,suddenly seen in the lamplight was that the woman was OLD. The paint was,1984,"Orwell, George"
1470,plastered so thick on her face that it looked as though it might crack,1984,"Orwell, George"
1471,like a cardboard mask. There were streaks of white in her hair; but the,1984,"Orwell, George"
1472,"truly dreadful detail was that her mouth had fallen a little open,",1984,"Orwell, George"
1473,revealing nothing except a cavernous blackness. She had no teeth at all.,1984,"Orwell, George"

1477,He pressed his fingers against his eyelids again. He had written it down,1984,"Orwell, George"
1478,"at last, but it made no difference. The therapy had not worked. The urge",1984,"Orwell, George"
1479,to shout filthy words at the top of his voice was as strong as ever.,1984,"Orwell, George"

1484,could the force to destroy the Party ever be generated. The Party could,1984,"Orwell, George"
1485,"not be overthrown from within. Its enemies, if it had any enemies, had",1984,"Orwell, George"
1486,no way of coming together or even of identifying one another. Even if,1984,"Orwell, George"
1487,"the legendary Brotherhood existed, as just possibly it might, it was",1984,"Orwell, George"
1488,inconceivable that its members could ever assemble in larger numbers than,1984,"Orwell, George"
1489,"twos and threes. Rebellion meant a look in the eyes, an inflexion of the",1984,"Orwell, George"
1490,"voice, at the most, an occasional whispered word. But the proles, if only",1984,"Orwell, George"
1491,they could somehow become conscious of their own strength. would have no,1984,"Orwell, George"
1492,need to conspire. They needed only to rise up and shake themselves like,1984,"Orwell, George"
1493,a horse shaking off flies. If they chose they could blow the Party to,1984,"Orwell, George"
1494,pieces tomorrow morning. Surely sooner or later it must occur to them to,1984,"Orwell, George"
1495,do it? And yet----!,1984,"Orwell, George"
1496,He remembered how once he had been walking down a crowded street when a,1984,"Orwell, George"
1497,"tremendous shout of hundreds of voices womens voices--had burst from a
side-street a little way ahead. It was a great formidable cry of anger
and despair, a deep, loud Oh-o-o-o-oh! that went humming on like the
reverberation of a bell. His heart had leapt. Its started! he had thought.",1984,"Orwell, George"
1498,A riot! The proles are breaking loose at last! When he had reached the spot,1984,"Orwell, George"
1499,it was to see a mob of two or three hundred women crowding round the stalls,1984,"Orwell, George"
1500,"of a street market, with faces as tragic as though they had been the doomed",1984,"Orwell, George"
1501,passengers on a sinking ship. But at this moment the general despair broke,1984,"Orwell, George"
1502,down into a multitude of individual quarrels. It appeared that one of the,1984,"Orwell, George"
1503,"stalls had been selling tin saucepans. They were wretched, flimsy things,",1984,"Orwell, George"
1504,but cooking-pots of any kind were always difficult to get. Now the supply,1984,"Orwell, George"
1505,"had unexpectedly given out. The successful women, bumped and jostled by",1984,"Orwell, George"
1506,"the rest, were trying to make off with their saucepans while dozens of",1984,"Orwell, George"
1507,"others clamoured round the stall, accusing the stall-keeper of favouritism",1984,"Orwell, George"
1508,and of having more saucepans somewhere in reserve. There was a fresh,1984,"Orwell, George"
1509,"outburst of yells. Two bloated women, one of them with her hair coming",1984,"Orwell, George"
1510,"down, had got hold of the same saucepan and were trying to tear it out of",1984,"Orwell, George"
1511,"one anothers hands. For a moment they were both tugging, and then the
handle came off. Winston watched them disgustedly. And yet, just for a
moment, what almost frightening power had sounded in that cry from only
a few hundred throats! Why was it that they could never shout like that
about anything that mattered?

He wrote:


   Until they become conscious they will never rebel, and until after they
have rebelled they cannot become conscious.


That, he reflected, might almost have been a transcription from one of the
Party textbooks. The Party claimed, of course, to have liberated the proles
from bondage. Before the Revolution they had been hideously oppressed by
the capitalists, they had been starved and flogged, women had been forced
to work in the coal mines (women still did work in the coal mines, as a
matter of fact), children had been sold into the factories at the age
of six. But simultaneously, true to the Principles of doublethink, the
Party taught that the proles were natural inferiors who must be kept in
subjection, like animals, by the application of a few simple rules. In
reality very little was known about the proles. It was not necessary to
know much. So long as they continued to work and breed, their other
activities were without importance. Left to themselves, like cattle turned
loose upon the plains of Argentina, they had reverted to a style of life
that appeared to be natural to them, a sort of ancestral pattern. They were
born, they grew up in the gutters, they went to work at twelve, they passed
through a brief blossoming-period of beauty and sexual desire, they married
at twenty, they were middle-aged at thirty, they died, for the most part,
at sixty. Heavy physical work, the care of home and children, petty
quarrels with neighbours, films, football, beer, and above all, gambling,
filled up the horizon of their minds. To keep them in control was not
difficult. A few agents of the Thought Police moved always among them,
spreading false rumours and marking down and eliminating the few
individuals who were judged capable of becoming dangerous; but no attempt
was made to indoctrinate them with the ideology of the Party. It was not
desirable that the proles should have strong political feelings. All that
was required of them was a primitive patriotism which could be appealed to
whenever it was necessary to make them accept longer working-hours or
shorter rations. And even when they became discontented, as they sometimes
did, their discontent led nowhere, because being without general ideas,
they could only focus it on petty specific grievances. The larger evils
invariably escaped their notice. The great majority of proles did not even
have telescreens in their homes. Even the civil police interfered with them
very little. There was a vast amount of criminality in London, a whole
world-within-a-world of thieves, bandits, prostitutes, drug-peddlers, and
racketeers of every description; but since it all happened among the proles
themselves, it was of no importance. In all questions of morals they were
allowed to follow their ancestral code. The sexual puritanism of the
Party was not imposed upon them. Promiscuity went unpunished, divorce
was permitted. For that matter, even religious worship would have been
permitted if the proles had shown any sign of needing or wanting it.
They were beneath suspicion. As the Party slogan put it: Proles and",1984,"Orwell, George"
1512,"animals are free.

Winston reached down and cautiously scratched his varicose ulcer. It
had begun itching again. The thing you invariably came back to was the
impossibility of knowing what life before the Revolution had really been
like. He took out of the drawer a copy of a childrens history textbook",1984,"Orwell, George"
1513,"which he had borrowed from Mrs Parsons, and began copying a passage into",1984,"Orwell, George"
1514,the diary:,1984,"Orwell, George"
1515,"   In the old days (it ran), before the glorious Revolution, London was",1984,"Orwell, George"
1516,"not the beautiful city that we know today. It was a dark, dirty, miserable",1984,"Orwell, George"
1517,place where hardly anybody had enough to eat and where hundreds and,1984,"Orwell, George"
1518,thousands of poor people had no boots on their feet and not even a roof to,1984,"Orwell, George"
1519,sleep under. Children no older than you had to work twelve hours a day for,1984,"Orwell, George"
1520,cruel masters who flogged them with whips if they worked too slowly and,1984,"Orwell, George"
1521,fed them on nothing but stale breadcrusts and water. But in among all,1984,"Orwell, George"
1522,this terrible poverty there were just a few great big beautiful houses,1984,"Orwell, George"
1523,that were lived in by rich men who had as many as thirty servants to look,1984,"Orwell, George"
1524,"after them. These rich men were called capitalists. They were fat, ugly",1984,"Orwell, George"
1525,"men with wicked faces, like the one in the picture on the opposite page.",1984,"Orwell, George"
1526,You can see that he is dressed in a long black coat which was called a,1984,"Orwell, George"
1527,"frock coat, and a queer, shiny hat shaped like a stovepipe, which was",1984,"Orwell, George"
1528,"called a top hat. This was the uniform of the capitalists, and no one else",1984,"Orwell, George"
1529,"was allowed to wear it. The capitalists owned everything in the world, and",1984,"Orwell, George"
1530,"everyone else was their slave. They owned all the land, all the houses,",1984,"Orwell, George"
1531,"all the factories, and all the money. If anyone disobeyed them they could",1984,"Orwell, George"
1532,"throw them into prison, or they could take his job away and starve him to",1984,"Orwell, George"
1533,death. When any ordinary person spoke to a capitalist he had to cringe and,1984,"Orwell, George"
1534,"bow to him, and take off his cap and address him as Sir. The chief of",1984,"Orwell, George"
1535,"all the capitalists was called the King, and----",1984,"Orwell, George"
1536,But he knew the rest of the catalogue. There would be mention of the,1984,"Orwell, George"
1537,"bishops in their lawn sleeves, the judges in their ermine robes, the",1984,"Orwell, George"
1538,"pillory, the stocks, the treadmill, the cat-o-nine tails, the Lord Mayors",1984,"Orwell, George"
1539,"Banquet, and the practice of kissing the Popes toe. There was also
something called the JUS PRIMAE NOCTIS, which would probably not be
mentioned in a textbook for children. It was the law by which every
capitalist had the right to sleep with any woman working in one of his
factories.

How could you tell how much of it was lies? It MIGHT be true that the
average human being was better off now than he had been before the
Revolution. The only evidence to the contrary was the mute protest in your
own bones, the instinctive feeling that the conditions you lived in were
intolerable and that at some other time they must have been different. It
struck him that the truly characteristic thing about modern life was not
its cruelty and insecurity, but simply its bareness, its dinginess, its
listlessness. Life, if you looked about you, bore no resemblance not only
to the lies that streamed out of the telescreens, but even to the ideals
that the Party was trying to achieve. Great areas of it, even for a Party
member, were neutral and non-political, a matter of slogging through dreary
jobs, fighting for a place on the Tube, darning a worn-out sock, cadging
a saccharine tablet, saving a cigarette end. The ideal set up by the
Party was something huge, terrible, and glittering--a world of steel
and concrete, of monstrous machines and terrifying weapons--a nation of
warriors and fanatics, marching forward in perfect unity, all thinking the
same thoughts and shouting the same slogans, perpetually working, fighting,
triumphing, persecuting--three hundred million people all with the same
face. The reality was decaying, dingy cities where underfed people shuffled
to and fro in leaky shoes, in patched-up nineteenth-century houses that
smelt always of cabbage and bad lavatories. He seemed to see a vision of
London, vast and ruinous, city of a million dustbins, and mixed up with it
was a picture of Mrs Parsons, a woman with lined face and wispy hair,
fiddling helplessly with a blocked waste-pipe.

He reached down and scratched his ankle again. Day and night the
telescreens bruised your ears with statistics proving that people today
had more food, more clothes, better houses, better recreations--that they
lived longer, worked shorter hours, were bigger, healthier, stronger,
happier, more intelligent, better educated, than the people of fifty years
ago. Not a word of it could ever be proved or disproved. The Party claimed,
for example, that today 40 per cent of adult proles were literate: before
the Revolution, it was said, the number had only been 15 per cent. The
Party claimed that the infant mortality rate was now only 160 per
thousand, whereas before the Revolution it had been 300--and so it went
on. It was like a single equation with two unknowns. It might very well be
that literally every word in the history books, even the things that one
accepted without question, was pure fantasy. For all he knew there might
never have been any such law as the JUS PRIMAE NOCTIS, or any such creature
as a capitalist, or any such garment as a top hat.

Everything faded into mist. The past was erased, the erasure was forgotten,
the lie became truth. Just once in his life he had possessed--AFTER the
event: that was what counted--concrete, unmistakable evidence of an act of
falsification. He had held it between his fingers for as long as thirty
seconds. In 1973, it must have been--at any rate, it was at about the time
when he and Katharine had parted. But the really relevant date was seven
or eight years earlier.

The story really began in the middle sixties, the period of the great
purges in which the original leaders of the Revolution were wiped out
once and for all. By 1970 none of them was left, except Big Brother
himself. All the rest had by that time been exposed as traitors and
counter-revolutionaries. Goldstein had fled and was hiding no one knew
where, and of the others, a few had simply disappeared, while the majority
had been executed after spectacular public trials at which they made
confession of their crimes. Among the last survivors were three men named
Jones, Aaronson, and Rutherford. It must have been in 1965 that these three
had been arrested. As often happened, they had vanished for a year or more,
so that one did not know whether they were alive or dead, and then had
suddenly been brought forth to incriminate themselves in the usual way.
They had confessed to intelligence with the enemy (at that date, too, the
enemy was Eurasia), embezzlement of public funds, the murder of various
trusted Party members, intrigues against the leadership of Big Brother
which had started long before the Revolution happened, and acts of sabotage
causing the death of hundreds of thousands of people. After confessing to
these things they had been pardoned, reinstated in the Party, and given
posts which were in fact sinecures but which sounded important. All three
had written long, abject articles in The Times, analysing the reasons
for their defection and promising to make amends.

Some time after their release Winston had actually seen all three of them
in the Chestnut Tree Cafe. He remembered the sort of terrified fascination
with which he had watched them out of the corner of his eye. They were men
far older than himself, relics of the ancient world, almost the last great
figures left over from the heroic days of the Party. The glamour of the
underground struggle and the civil war still faintly clung to them. He had
the feeling, though already at that time facts and dates were growing
blurry, that he had known their names years earlier than he had known that
of Big Brother. But also they were outlaws, enemies, untouchables, doomed
with absolute certainty to extinction within a year or two. No one who had
once fallen into the hands of the Thought Police ever escaped in the end.
They were corpses waiting to be sent back to the grave.

There was no one at any of the tables nearest to them. It was not wise
even to be seen in the neighbourhood of such people. They were sitting
in silence before glasses of the gin flavoured with cloves which was the
speciality of the cafe. Of the three, it was Rutherford whose appearance
had most impressed Winston. Rutherford had once been a famous caricaturist,
whose brutal cartoons had helped to inflame popular opinion before and
during the Revolution. Even now, at long intervals, his cartoons were
appearing in The Times. They were simply an imitation of his earlier
manner, and curiously lifeless and unconvincing. Always they were a
rehashing of the ancient themes--slum tenements, starving children, street
battles, capitalists in top hats--even on the barricades the capitalists
still seemed to cling to their top hats an endless, hopeless effort to
get back into the past. He was a monstrous man, with a mane of greasy
grey hair, his face pouched and seamed, with thick negroid lips. At one
time he must have been immensely strong; now his great body was sagging,
sloping, bulging, falling away in every direction. He seemed to be breaking
up before ones eyes, like a mountain crumbling.",1984,"Orwell, George"
1540,It was the lonely hour of fifteen. Winston could not now remember how he,1984,"Orwell, George"
1541,had come to be in the cafe at such a time. The place was almost empty. A,1984,"Orwell, George"
1542,tinny music was trickling from the telescreens. The three men sat in their,1984,"Orwell, George"
1543,"corner almost motionless, never speaking. Uncommanded, the waiter brought",1984,"Orwell, George"
1544,"fresh glasses of gin. There was a chessboard on the table beside them, with",1984,"Orwell, George"
1545,"the pieces set out but no game started. And then, for perhaps half a minute",1984,"Orwell, George"
1546,"in all, something happened to the telescreens. The tune that they were",1984,"Orwell, George"
1547,"playing changed, and the tone of the music changed too. There came into",1984,"Orwell, George"
1548,"it--but it was something hard to describe. It was a peculiar, cracked,",1984,"Orwell, George"
1549,"braying, jeering note: in his mind Winston called it a yellow note. And",1984,"Orwell, George"
1550,then a voice from the telescreen was singing:,1984,"Orwell, George"
1551,  Under the spreading chestnut tree,1984,"Orwell, George"
1552,  I sold you and you sold me:,1984,"Orwell, George"
1553,"  There lie they, and here lie we",1984,"Orwell, George"
1554,  Under the spreading chestnut tree.,1984,"Orwell, George"
1555,"The three men never stirred. But when Winston glanced again at Rutherfords
ruinous face, he saw that his eyes were full of tears. And for the first
time he noticed, with a kind of inward shudder, and yet not knowing
AT WHAT he shuddered, that both Aaronson and Rutherford had broken noses.

A little later all three were re-arrested. It appeared that they had
engaged in fresh conspiracies from the very moment of their release. At
their second trial they confessed to all their old crimes over again, with
a whole string of new ones. They were executed, and their fate was recorded
in the Party histories, a warning to posterity. About five years after
this, in 1973, Winston was unrolling a wad of documents which had just
flopped out of the pneumatic tube on to his desk when he came on a fragment
of paper which had evidently been slipped in among the others and then
forgotten. The instant he had flattened it out he saw its significance.
It was a half-page torn out of The Times of about ten years earlier--the
top half of the page, so that it included the date--and it contained a
photograph of the delegates at some Party function in New York. Prominent
in the middle of the group were Jones, Aaronson, and Rutherford. There was
no mistaking them, in any case their names were in the caption at the
bottom.

The point was that at both trials all three men had confessed that on that
date they had been on Eurasian soil. They had flown from a secret airfield
in Canada to a rendezvous somewhere in Siberia, and had conferred with
members of the Eurasian General Staff, to whom they had betrayed important
military secrets. The date had stuck in Winstons memory because it chanced",1984,"Orwell, George"
1556,to be midsummer day; but the whole story must be on record in countless,1984,"Orwell, George"
1557,other places as well. There was only one possible conclusion: the,1984,"Orwell, George"
1558,confessions were lies.,1984,"Orwell, George"
1559,"Of course, this was not in itself a discovery. Even at that time Winston",1984,"Orwell, George"
1560,had not imagined that the people who were wiped out in the purges had,1984,"Orwell, George"
1561,actually committed the crimes that they were accused of. But this was,1984,"Orwell, George"
1562,"concrete evidence; it was a fragment of the abolished past, like a fossil",1984,"Orwell, George"
1563,bone which turns up in the wrong stratum and destroys a geological theory.,1984,"Orwell, George"
1564,"It was enough to blow the Party to atoms, if in some way it could have",1984,"Orwell, George"
1565,been published to the world and its significance made known.,1984,"Orwell, George"
1566,He had gone straight on working. As soon as he saw what the photograph,1984,"Orwell, George"
1567,"was, and what it meant, he had covered it up with another sheet of paper.",1984,"Orwell, George"
1568,"Luckily, when he unrolled it, it had been upside-down from the point of",1984,"Orwell, George"
1569,view of the telescreen.,1984,"Orwell, George"
1570,He took his scribbling pad on his knee and pushed back his chair so as,1984,"Orwell, George"
1571,to get as far away from the telescreen as possible. To keep your face,1984,"Orwell, George"
1572,"expressionless was not difficult, and even your breathing could be",1984,"Orwell, George"
1573,"controlled, with an effort: but you could not control the beating of your",1984,"Orwell, George"
1574,"heart, and the telescreen was quite delicate enough to pick it up. He let",1984,"Orwell, George"
1575,"what he judged to be ten minutes go by, tormented all the while by the",1984,"Orwell, George"
1576,"fear that some accident--a sudden draught blowing across his desk, for",1984,"Orwell, George"
1577,"instance--would betray him. Then, without uncovering it again, he dropped",1984,"Orwell, George"
1578,"the photograph into the memory hole, along with some other waste papers.",1984,"Orwell, George"
1579,"Within another minute, perhaps, it would have crumbled into ashes.",1984,"Orwell, George"
1580,"That was ten--eleven years ago. Today, probably, he would have kept that",1984,"Orwell, George"
1581,photograph. It was curious that the fact of having held it in his fingers,1984,"Orwell, George"
1582,"seemed to him to make a difference even now, when the photograph itself,",1984,"Orwell, George"
1583,"as well as the event it recorded, was only memory. Was the Partys hold
upon the past less strong, he wondered, because a piece of evidence which
existed no longer HAD ONCE existed?

But today, supposing that it could be somehow resurrected from its ashes,
the photograph might not even be evidence. Already, at the time when he
made his discovery, Oceania was no longer at war with Eurasia, and it must
have been to the agents of Eastasia that the three dead men had betrayed
their country. Since then there had been other changes--two, three,
he could not remember how many. Very likely the confessions had been
rewritten and rewritten until the original facts and dates no longer
had the smallest significance. The past not only changed, but changed
continuously. What most afflicted him with the sense of nightmare was that
he had never clearly understood why the huge imposture was undertaken.
The immediate advantages of falsifying the past were obvious, but the
ultimate motive was mysterious. He took up his pen again and wrote:


   I understand HOW: I do not understand WHY.


He wondered, as he had many times wondered before, whether he himself was
a lunatic. Perhaps a lunatic was simply a minority of one. At one time it
had been a sign of madness to believe that the earth goes round the sun;
today, to believe that the past is unalterable. He might be ALONE in
holding that belief, and if alone, then a lunatic. But the thought of being
a lunatic did not greatly trouble him: the horror was that he might also
be wrong.

He picked up the childrens history book and looked at the portrait of",1984,"Orwell, George"
1584,Big Brother which formed its frontispiece. The hypnotic eyes gazed into,1984,"Orwell, George"
1585,his own. It was as though some huge force were pressing down upon,1984,"Orwell, George"
1586,"you--something that penetrated inside your skull, battering against your",1984,"Orwell, George"
1587,"brain, frightening you out of your beliefs, persuading you, almost, to",1984,"Orwell, George"
1588,deny the evidence of your senses. In the end the Party would announce that,1984,"Orwell, George"
1589,"two and two made five, and you would have to believe it. It was inevitable",1984,"Orwell, George"
1590,that they should make that claim sooner or later: the logic of their,1984,"Orwell, George"
1591,"position demanded it. Not merely the validity of experience, but the very",1984,"Orwell, George"
1592,"existence of external reality, was tacitly denied by their philosophy. The",1984,"Orwell, George"
1593,heresy of heresies was common sense. And what was terrifying was not that,1984,"Orwell, George"
1594,"they would kill you for thinking otherwise, but that they might be right.",1984,"Orwell, George"
1595,"For, after all, how do we know that two and two make four? Or that the",1984,"Orwell, George"
1596,force of gravity works? Or that the past is unchangeable? If both the past,1984,"Orwell, George"
1597,"and the external world exist only in the mind, and if the mind itself is",1984,"Orwell, George"
1598,controllable what then?,1984,"Orwell, George"
1599,But no! His courage seemed suddenly to stiffen of its own accord. The face,1984,"Orwell, George"
1600,"of OBrien, not called up by any obvious association, had floated into his
mind. He knew, with more certainty than before, that OBrien was on his",1984,"Orwell, George"
1601,side. He was writing the diary for OBrien--TO OBrien: it was like an,1984,"Orwell, George"
1602,"interminable letter which no one would ever read, but which was addressed",1984,"Orwell, George"
1603,to a particular person and took its colour from that fact.,1984,"Orwell, George"
1604,The Party told you to reject the evidence of your eyes and ears. It was,1984,"Orwell, George"
1605,"their final, most essential command. His heart sank as he thought of",1984,"Orwell, George"
1606,"the enormous power arrayed against him, the ease with which any Party",1984,"Orwell, George"
1607,"intellectual would overthrow him in debate, the subtle arguments which he",1984,"Orwell, George"
1608,"would not be able to understand, much less answer. And yet he was in the",1984,"Orwell, George"
1609,"right! They were wrong and he was right. The obvious, the silly, and the",1984,"Orwell, George"
1610,"true had got to be defended. Truisms are true, hold on to that! The solid",1984,"Orwell, George"
1611,"world exists, its laws do not change. Stones are hard, water is wet,",1984,"Orwell, George"
1612,"objects unsupported fall towards the earths centre. With the feeling that
he was speaking to OBrien, and also that he was setting forth an important",1984,"Orwell, George"
1613,"axiom, he wrote:",1984,"Orwell, George"
1614,   Freedom is the freedom to say that two plus two make four. If that is,1984,"Orwell, George"
1615,"granted, all else follows.",1984,"Orwell, George"

1619,Winston paused involuntarily. For perhaps two seconds he was back in the,1984,"Orwell, George"
1620,"half-forgotten world of his childhood. Then a door banged, seeming to cut",1984,"Orwell, George"
1621,off the smell as abruptly as though it had been a sound.,1984,"Orwell, George"
1622,"He had walked several kilometres over pavements, and his varicose ulcer",1984,"Orwell, George"
1623,was throbbing. This was the second time in three weeks that he had missed,1984,"Orwell, George"
1624,"an evening at the Community Centre: a rash act, since you could be certain",1984,"Orwell, George"
1625,that the number of your attendances at the Centre was carefully checked.,1984,"Orwell, George"
1626,"In principle a Party member had no spare time, and was never alone except",1984,"Orwell, George"
1627,"in bed. It was assumed that when he was not working, eating, or sleeping",1984,"Orwell, George"
1628,he would be taking part in some kind of communal recreation: to do anything,1984,"Orwell, George"
1629,"that suggested a taste for solitude, even to go for a walk by yourself,",1984,"Orwell, George"
1630,was always slightly dangerous. There was a word for it in Newspeak:,1984,"Orwell, George"
1631,"OWNLIFE, it was called, meaning individualism and eccentricity. But this",1984,"Orwell, George"
1632,evening as he came out of the Ministry the balminess of the April air had,1984,"Orwell, George"
1633,"tempted him. The sky was a warmer blue than he had seen it that year, and",1984,"Orwell, George"
1634,"suddenly the long, noisy evening at the Centre, the boring, exhausting",1984,"Orwell, George"
1635,"games, the lectures, the creaking camaraderie oiled by gin, had seemed",1984,"Orwell, George"
1636,intolerable. On impulse he had turned away from the bus-stop and wandered,1984,"Orwell, George"
1637,"off into the labyrinth of London, first south, then east, then north again,",1984,"Orwell, George"
1638,losing himself among unknown streets and hardly bothering in which,1984,"Orwell, George"
1639,direction he was going.,1984,"Orwell, George"
1640,"If there is hope, he had written in the diary, it lies in the proles.",1984,"Orwell, George"
1641,"The words kept coming back to him, statement of a mystical truth and a",1984,"Orwell, George"
1642,"palpable absurdity. He was somewhere in the vague, brown-coloured slums",1984,"Orwell, George"
1643,to the north and east of what had once been Saint Pancras Station. He was,1984,"Orwell, George"
1644,walking up a cobbled street of little two-storey houses with battered,1984,"Orwell, George"
1645,doorways which gave straight on the pavement and which were somehow,1984,"Orwell, George"
1646,curiously suggestive of ratholes. There were puddles of filthy water here,1984,"Orwell, George"
1647,"and there among the cobbles. In and out of the dark doorways, and down",1984,"Orwell, George"
1648,"narrow alley-ways that branched off on either side, people swarmed in",1984,"Orwell, George"
1649,"astonishing numbers--girls in full bloom, with crudely lipsticked mouths,",1984,"Orwell, George"
1650,"and youths who chased the girls, and swollen waddling women who showed you",1984,"Orwell, George"
1651,"what the girls would be like in ten years time, and old bent creatures
shuffling along on splayed feet, and ragged barefooted children who played
in the puddles and then scattered at angry yells from their mothers.
Perhaps a quarter of the windows in the street were broken and boarded up.
Most of the people paid no attention to Winston; a few eyed him with a
sort of guarded curiosity. Two monstrous women with brick-red forearms
folded across their aprons were talking outside a doorway. Winston caught
scraps of conversation as he approached.

Yes, I says to er, ""thats all very well, I says. But if youd of
been in my place youd of done the same as what I done. Its easy to
criticize,"" I says, ""but you aint got the same problems as what I got.'

'Ah,' said the other, 'that's jest it. That's jest where it is.'

The strident voices stopped abruptly. The women studied him in hostile
silence as he went past. But it was not hostility, exactly; merely a kind
of wariness, a momentary stiffening, as at the passing of some unfamiliar
animal. The blue overalls of the Party could not be a common sight in a
street like this. Indeed, it was unwise to be seen in such places, unless
you had definite business there. The patrols might stop you if you happened
to run into them. 'May I see your papers, comrade? What are you doing here?
What time did you leave work? Is this your usual way home?'--and so on and
so forth. Not that there was any rule against walking home by an unusual
route: but it was enough to draw attention to you if the Thought Police
heard about it.

Suddenly the whole street was in commotion. There were yells of warning
from all sides. People were shooting into the doorways like rabbits. A
young woman leapt out of a doorway a little ahead of Winston, grabbed up a
tiny child playing in a puddle, whipped her apron round it, and leapt back
again, all in one movement. At the same instant a man in a concertina-like
black suit, who had emerged from a side alley, ran towards Winston,
pointing excitedly to the sky.

'Steamer!' he yelled. 'Look out, guv'nor! Bang over'ead! Lay down quick!'

'Steamer' was a nickname which, for some reason, the proles applied to
rocket bombs. Winston promptly flung himself on his face. The proles were
nearly always right when they gave you a warning of this kind. They seemed
to possess some kind of instinct which told them several seconds in advance
when a rocket was coming, although the rockets supposedly travelled faster
than sound. Winston clasped his forearms above his head. There was a roar
that seemed to make the pavement heave; a shower of light objects pattered
on to his back. When he stood up he found that he was covered with
fragments of glass from the nearest window.

He walked on. The bomb had demolished a group of houses 200 metres up the
street. A black plume of smoke hung in the sky, and below it a cloud of
plaster dust in which a crowd was already forming around the ruins. There
was a little pile of plaster lying on the pavement ahead of him, and in
the middle of it he could see a bright red streak. When he got up to it he
saw that it was a human hand severed at the wrist. Apart from the bloody
stump, the hand was so completely whitened as to resemble a plaster cast.

He kicked the thing into the gutter, and then, to avoid the crowd, turned
down a side-street to the right. Within three or four minutes he was out
of the area which the bomb had affected, and the sordid swarming life of
the streets was going on as though nothing had happened. It was nearly
twenty hours, and the drinking-shops which the proles frequented ('pubs',
they called them) were choked with customers. From their grimy swing doors,
endlessly opening and shutting, there came forth a smell of urine, sawdust,
and sour beer. In an angle formed by a projecting house-front three men
were standing very close together, the middle one of them holding a
folded-up newspaper which the other two were studying over his shoulder.
Even before he was near enough to make out the expression on their faces,
Winston could see absorption in every line of their bodies. It was
obviously some serious piece of news that they were reading. He was a few
paces away from them when suddenly the group broke up and two of the men
were in violent altercation. For a moment they seemed almost on the point
of blows.

'Can't you bleeding well listen to what I say? I tell you no number ending
in seven ain't won for over fourteen months!'

'Yes, it 'as, then!'

'No, it 'as not! Back 'ome I got the 'ole lot of 'em for over two years
wrote down on a piece of paper. I takes 'em down reg'lar as the clock. An'
I tell you, no number ending in seven----'

'Yes, a seven 'AS won! I could pretty near tell you the bleeding number.
Four oh seven, it ended in. It were in February--second week in February.'

'February your grandmother! I got it all down in black and white. An' I
tell you, no number----'

'Oh, pack it in!' said the third man.

They were talking about the Lottery. Winston looked back when he had gone
thirty metres. They were still arguing, with vivid, passionate faces.
The Lottery, with its weekly pay-out of enormous prizes, was the one public
event to which the proles paid serious attention. It was probable that
there were some millions of proles for whom the Lottery was the principal
if not the only reason for remaining alive. It was their delight, their
folly, their anodyne, their intellectual stimulant. Where the Lottery was
concerned, even people who could barely read and write seemed capable of
intricate calculations and staggering feats of memory. There was a whole
tribe of men who made a living simply by selling systems, forecasts, and
lucky amulets. Winston had nothing to do with the running of the Lottery,
which was managed by the Ministry of Plenty, but he was aware (indeed
everyone in the party was aware) that the prizes were largely imaginary.
Only small sums were actually paid out, the winners of the big prizes being
non-existent persons. In the absence of any real intercommunication between
one part of Oceania and another, this was not difficult to arrange.

But if there was hope, it lay in the proles. You had to cling on to that.
When you put it in words it sounded reasonable: it was when you looked at
the human beings passing you on the pavement that it became an act of
faith. The street into which he had turned ran downhill. He had a feeling
that he had been in this neighbourhood before, and that there was a main
thoroughfare not far away. From somewhere ahead there came a din of
shouting voices. The street took a sharp turn and then ended in a flight
of steps which led down into a sunken alley where a few stall-keepers
were selling tired-looking vegetables. At this moment Winston remembered
where he was. The alley led out into the main street, and down the next
turning, not five minutes away, was the junk-shop where he had bought the
blank book which was now his diary. And in a small stationer's shop not
far away he had bought his penholder and his bottle of ink.

He paused for a moment at the top of the steps. On the opposite side of
the alley there was a dingy little pub whose windows appeared to be frosted
over but in reality were merely coated with dust. A very old man, bent but
active, with white moustaches that bristled forward like those of a prawn,
pushed open the swing door and went in. As Winston stood watching, it
occurred to him that the old man, who must be eighty at the least, had
already been middle-aged when the Revolution happened. He and a few others
like him were the last links that now existed with the vanished world of
capitalism. In the Party itself there were not many people left whose ideas
had been formed before the Revolution. The older generation had mostly
been wiped out in the great purges of the fifties and sixties, and the few
who survived had long ago been terrified into complete intellectual
surrender. If there was any one still alive who could give you a truthful
account of conditions in the early part of the century, it could only be a
prole. Suddenly the passage from the history book that he had copied into
his diary came back into Winston's mind, and a lunatic impulse took hold
of him. He would go into the pub, he would scrape acquaintance with that
old man and question him. He would say to him: 'Tell me about your life
when you were a boy. What was it like in those days? Were things better
than they are now, or were they worse?'

Hurriedly, lest he should have time to become frightened, he descended the
steps and crossed the narrow street. It was madness of course. As usual,
there was no definite rule against talking to proles and frequenting their
pubs, but it was far too unusual an action to pass unnoticed. If the
patrols appeared he might plead an attack of faintness, but it was not
likely that they would believe him. He pushed open the door, and a hideous
cheesy smell of sour beer hit him in the face. As he entered the din of
voices dropped to about half its volume. Behind his back he could feel
everyone eyeing his blue overalls. A game of darts which was going on at
the other end of the room interrupted itself for perhaps as much as thirty
seconds. The old man whom he had followed was standing at the bar, having
some kind of altercation with the barman, a large, stout, hook-nosed young
man with enormous forearms. A knot of others, standing round with glasses
in their hands, were watching the scene.

'I arst you civil enough, didn't I?' said the old man, straightening his
shoulders pugnaciously. 'You telling me you ain't got a pint mug in the
'ole bleeding boozer?'

'And what in hell's name IS a pint?' said the barman, leaning forward with
the tips of his fingers on the counter.

''Ark at 'im! Calls 'isself a barman and don't know what a pint is! Why,
a pint's the 'alf of a quart, and there's four quarts to the gallon.
'Ave to teach you the A, B, C next.'

'Never heard of 'em,' said the barman shortly. 'Litre and half
litre--that's all we serve. There's the glasses on the shelf in front
of you.'

'I likes a pint,' persisted the old man. 'You could 'a drawed me off a pint
easy enough. We didn't 'ave these bleeding litres when I was a young man.'

'When you were a young man we were all living in the treetops,' said the
barman, with a glance at the other customers.

There was a shout of laughter, and the uneasiness caused by Winston's entry
seemed to disappear. The old man's white-stubbled face had flushed pink. He
turned away, muttering to himself, and bumped into Winston. Winston caught
him gently by the arm.

'May I offer you a drink?' he said.

'You're a gent,' said the other, straightening his shoulders again. He
appeared not to have noticed Winston's blue overalls. 'Pint!' he added
aggressively to the barman. 'Pint of wallop.'

The barman swished two half-litres of dark-brown beer into thick glasses
which he had rinsed in a bucket under the counter. Beer was the only drink
you could get in prole pubs. The proles were supposed not to drink gin,
though in practice they could get hold of it easily enough. The game of
darts was in full swing again, and the knot of men at the bar had begun
talking about lottery tickets. Winston's presence was forgotten for a
moment. There was a deal table under the window where he and the old man
could talk without fear of being overheard. It was horribly dangerous, but
at any rate there was no telescreen in the room, a point he had made sure
of as soon as he came in.

''E could 'a drawed me off a pint,' grumbled the old man as he settled down
behind a glass. 'A 'alf litre ain't enough. It don't satisfy. And a 'ole
litre's too much. It starts my bladder running. Let alone the price.'

'You must have seen great changes since you were a young man,' said
Winston tentatively.

The old man's pale blue eyes moved from the darts board to the bar, and
from the bar to the door of the Gents, as though it were in the bar-room
that he expected the changes to have occurred.

'The beer was better,' he said finally. 'And cheaper! When I was a young
man, mild beer--wallop we used to call it--was fourpence a pint. That was
before the war, of course.'

'Which war was that?' said Winston.

'It's all wars,' said the old man vaguely. He took up his glass, and his
shoulders straightened again. ''Ere's wishing you the very best of 'ealth!'

In his lean throat the sharp-pointed Adam's apple made a surprisingly rapid
up-and-down movement, and the beer vanished. Winston went to the bar and
came back with two more half-litres. The old man appeared to have forgotten
his prejudice against drinking a full litre.

'You are very much older than I am,' said Winston. 'You must have been a
grown man before I was born. You can remember what it was like in the old
days, before the Revolution. People of my age don't really know anything
about those times. We can only read about them in books, and what it says
in the books may not be true. I should like your opinion on that. The
history books say that life before the Revolution was completely different
from what it is now. There was the most terrible oppression, injustice,
poverty worse than anything we can imagine. Here in London, the great mass
of the people never had enough to eat from birth to death. Half of them
hadn't even boots on their feet. They worked twelve hours a day, they left
school at nine, they slept ten in a room. And at the same time there were
a very few people, only a few thousands--the capitalists, they were
called--who were rich and powerful. They owned everything that there was
to own. They lived in great gorgeous houses with thirty servants, they
rode about in motor-cars and four-horse carriages, they drank champagne,
they wore top hats----'

The old man brightened suddenly.

'Top 'ats!' he said. 'Funny you should mention 'em. The same thing come
into my 'ead only yesterday, I dono why. I was jest thinking, I ain't seen
a top 'at in years. Gorn right out, they 'ave. The last time I wore one
was at my sister-in-law's funeral. And that was--well, I couldn't give you
the date, but it must'a been fifty years ago. Of course it was only 'ired
for the occasion, you understand.'

'It isn't very important about the top hats,' said Winston patiently.
'The point is, these capitalists--they and a few lawyers and priests and
so forth who lived on them--were the lords of the earth. Everything existed
for their benefit. You--the ordinary people, the workers--were their
slaves. They could do what they liked with you. They could ship you off to
Canada like cattle. They could sleep with your daughters if they chose.
They could order you to be flogged with something called a cat-o'-nine
tails. You had to take your cap off when you passed them. Every capitalist
went about with a gang of lackeys who----'

The old man brightened again.

'Lackeys!' he said. 'Now there's a word I ain't 'eard since ever so long.
Lackeys! That reg'lar takes me back, that does. I recollect--oh, donkey's
years ago--I used to sometimes go to 'Yde Park of a Sunday afternoon to
'ear the blokes making speeches. Salvation Army, Roman Catholics, Jews,
Indians--all sorts there was. And there was one bloke--well, I couldn't
give you 'is name, but a real powerful speaker 'e was. 'E didn't 'alf
give it 'em! Lackeys! 'e says, lackeys of the bourgeoisie! Flunkies of",1984,"Orwell, George"
1652,"the ruling class! Parasites--that was another of them. And 'yenas--'e
definitely called 'em 'yenas. Of course 'e was referring to the Labour
Party, you understand.'

Winston had the feeling that they were talking at cross-purposes.

'What I really wanted to know was this,' he said. 'Do you feel that you
have more freedom now than you had in those days? Are you treated more
like a human being? In the old days, the rich people, the people at the
top----'

'The 'Ouse of Lords,' put in the old man reminiscently.

'The House of Lords, if you like. What I am asking is, were these people
able to treat you as an inferior, simply because they were rich and you
were poor? Is it a fact, for instance, that you had to call them Sir and
take off your cap when you passed them?'

The old man appeared to think deeply. He drank off about a quarter of his
beer before answering.

'Yes,' he said. 'They liked you to touch your cap to 'em. It showed
respect, like. I didn't agree with it, myself, but I done it often enough.
Had to, as you might say.'

'And was it usual--I'm only quoting what I've read in history books--was
it usual for these people and their servants to push you off the pavement
into the gutter?'

'One of 'em pushed me once,' said the old man. 'I recollect it as if it
was yesterday. It was Boat Race night--terribly rowdy they used to get on
Boat Race night--and I bumps into a young bloke on Shaftesbury Avenue.
Quite a gent, 'e was--dress shirt, top 'at, black overcoat. 'E was kind
of zig-zagging across the pavement, and I bumps into 'im accidental-like.
'E says, Why cant you look where youre going? 'e says. I say, Ju think",1984,"Orwell, George"
1653,"youve bought the bleeding pavement?"" E says, I'll twist your bloody 'ead
off if you get fresh with me. I says, You're drunk. I'll give you in
charge in 'alf a minute, I says. An if youll believe me, e puts is",1984,"Orwell, George"
1654,"and on my chest and gives me a shove as pretty near sent me under the
wheels of a bus. Well, I was young in them days, and I was going to ave",1984,"Orwell, George"
1655,"fetched im one, only----",1984,"Orwell, George"
1656,"A sense of helplessness took hold of Winston. The old mans memory was
nothing but a rubbish-heap of details. One could question him all day
without getting any real information. The party histories might still be
true, after a fashion: they might even be completely true. He made a last
attempt.

Perhaps I have not made myself clear, he said. What Im trying to say
is this. You have been alive a very long time; you lived half your life
before the Revolution. In 1925, for instance, you were already grown up.
Would you say from what you can remember, that life in 1925 was better
than it is now, or worse? If you could choose, would you prefer to live
then or now?",1984,"Orwell, George"
1657,The old man looked meditatively at the darts board. He finished up his,1984,"Orwell, George"
1658,"beer, more slowly than before. When he spoke it was with a tolerant",1984,"Orwell, George"
1659,"philosophical air, as though the beer had mellowed him.",1984,"Orwell, George"
1660,"I know what you expect me to say, he said. You expect me to say as Id",1984,"Orwell, George"
1661,"sooner be young again. Most peopled say theyd sooner be young, if you",1984,"Orwell, George"
1662,"arst em. You got your ealth and strength when youre young. When you
get to my time of life you aint never well. I suffer something wicked",1984,"Orwell, George"
1663,"from my feet, and my bladders jest terrible. Six and seven times a night
it as me out of bed. On the other and, theres great advantages in being",1984,"Orwell, George"
1664,"a old man. You aint got the same worries. No truck with women, and thats",1984,"Orwell, George"
1665,"a great thing. I aint ad a woman for near on thirty year, if youd
credit it. Nor wanted to, whats more.

Winston sat back against the window-sill. It was no use going on. He was
about to buy some more beer when the old man suddenly got up and shuffled
rapidly into the stinking urinal at the side of the room. The extra
half-litre was already working on him. Winston sat for a minute or two
gazing at his empty glass, and hardly noticed when his feet carried him out
into the street again. Within twenty years at the most, he reflected, the
huge and simple question, Was life better before the Revolution than it",1984,"Orwell, George"
1666,"is now? would have ceased once and for all to be answerable. But in effect
it was unanswerable even now, since the few scattered survivors from the
ancient world were incapable of comparing one age with another. They
remembered a million useless things, a quarrel with a workmate, a hunt for
a lost bicycle pump, the expression on a long-dead sisters face, the",1984,"Orwell, George"
1667,swirls of dust on a windy morning seventy years ago: but all the relevant,1984,"Orwell, George"
1668,"facts were outside the range of their vision. They were like the ant,",1984,"Orwell, George"
1669,which can see small objects but not large ones. And when memory failed and,1984,"Orwell, George"
1670,"written records were falsified--when that happened, the claim of the Party",1984,"Orwell, George"
1671,"to have improved the conditions of human life had got to be accepted,",1984,"Orwell, George"
1672,"because there did not exist, and never again could exist, any standard",1984,"Orwell, George"
1673,against which it could be tested.,1984,"Orwell, George"
1674,At this moment his train of thought stopped abruptly. He halted and looked,1984,"Orwell, George"
1675,"up. He was in a narrow street, with a few dark little shops, interspersed",1984,"Orwell, George"
1676,among dwelling-houses. Immediately above his head there hung three,1984,"Orwell, George"
1677,discoloured metal balls which looked as if they had once been gilded. He,1984,"Orwell, George"
1678,seemed to know the place. Of course! He was standing outside the junk-shop,1984,"Orwell, George"
1679,where he had bought the diary.,1984,"Orwell, George"
1680,A twinge of fear went through him. It had been a sufficiently rash act to,1984,"Orwell, George"
1681,"buy the book in the beginning, and he had sworn never to come near the",1984,"Orwell, George"
1682,"place again. And yet the instant that he allowed his thoughts to wander,",1984,"Orwell, George"
1683,his feet had brought him back here of their own accord. It was precisely,1984,"Orwell, George"
1684,against suicidal impulses of this kind that he had hoped to guard himself,1984,"Orwell, George"
1685,by opening the diary. At the same time he noticed that although it was,1984,"Orwell, George"
1686,nearly twenty-one hours the shop was still open. With the feeling that he,1984,"Orwell, George"
1687,"would be less conspicuous inside than hanging about on the pavement, he",1984,"Orwell, George"
1688,"stepped through the doorway. If questioned, he could plausibly say that",1984,"Orwell, George"
1689,he was trying to buy razor blades.,1984,"Orwell, George"
1690,The proprietor had just lighted a hanging oil lamp which gave off an,1984,"Orwell, George"
1691,"unclean but friendly smell. He was a man of perhaps sixty, frail and",1984,"Orwell, George"
1692,"bowed, with a long, benevolent nose, and mild eyes distorted by thick",1984,"Orwell, George"
1693,"spectacles. His hair was almost white, but his eyebrows were bushy and",1984,"Orwell, George"
1694,"still black. His spectacles, his gentle, fussy movements, and the fact",1984,"Orwell, George"
1695,"that he was wearing an aged jacket of black velvet, gave him a vague air",1984,"Orwell, George"
1696,"of intellectuality, as though he had been some kind of literary man, or",1984,"Orwell, George"
1697,"perhaps a musician. His voice was soft, as though faded, and his accent",1984,"Orwell, George"
1698,less debased than that of the majority of proles.,1984,"Orwell, George"
1699,"I recognized you on the pavement, he said immediately. Youre the",1984,"Orwell, George"
1700,"gentleman that bought the young ladys keepsake album. That was a beautiful
bit of paper, that was. Cream-laid, it used to be called. Theres been no",1984,"Orwell, George"
1701,"paper like that made for--oh, I dare say fifty years. He peered at Winston
over the top of his spectacles. Is there anything special I can do for",1984,"Orwell, George"
1702,"you? Or did you just want to look round?

I was passing, said Winston vaguely. I just looked in. I dont want
anything in particular.",1984,"Orwell, George"
1703,"Its just as well, said the other, because I dont suppose I could have
satisfied you. He made an apologetic gesture with his softpalmed hand.",1984,"Orwell, George"
1704,"You see how it is; an empty shop, you might say. Between you and me, the
antique trades just about finished. No demand any longer, and no stock",1984,"Orwell, George"
1705,"either. Furniture, china, glass its all been broken up by degrees. And
of course the metal stuffs mostly been melted down. I havent seen a brass
candlestick in years.",1984,"Orwell, George"
1706,"The tiny interior of the shop was in fact uncomfortably full, but there",1984,"Orwell, George"
1707,was almost nothing in it of the slightest value. The floorspace was very,1984,"Orwell, George"
1708,"restricted, because all round the walls were stacked innumerable dusty",1984,"Orwell, George"
1709,"picture-frames. In the window there were trays of nuts and bolts, worn-out",1984,"Orwell, George"
1710,"chisels, penknives with broken blades, tarnished watches that did not even",1984,"Orwell, George"
1711,"pretend to be in going order, and other miscellaneous rubbish. Only on a",1984,"Orwell, George"
1712,small table in the corner was there a litter of odds and ends--lacquered,1984,"Orwell, George"
1713,"snuffboxes, agate brooches, and the like--which looked as though they might",1984,"Orwell, George"
1714,include something interesting. As Winston wandered towards the table his,1984,"Orwell, George"
1715,"eye was caught by a round, smooth thing that gleamed softly in the",1984,"Orwell, George"
1716,"lamplight, and he picked it up.",1984,"Orwell, George"
1717,"It was a heavy lump of glass, curved on one side, flat on the other, making",1984,"Orwell, George"
1718,"almost a hemisphere. There was a peculiar softness, as of rainwater, in",1984,"Orwell, George"
1719,"both the colour and the texture of the glass. At the heart of it, magnified",1984,"Orwell, George"
1720,"by the curved surface, there was a strange, pink, convoluted object that",1984,"Orwell, George"
1721,recalled a rose or a sea anemone.,1984,"Orwell, George"
1722,"What is it? said Winston, fascinated.",1984,"Orwell, George"
1723,"Thats coral, that is, said the old man. It must have come from the",1984,"Orwell, George"
1724,"Indian Ocean. They used to kind of embed it in the glass. That wasnt made
less than a hundred years ago. More, by the look of it.",1984,"Orwell, George"
1725,"Its a beautiful thing, said Winston.

It is a beautiful thing, said the other appreciatively. But theres not
many thatd say so nowadays. He coughed. Now, if it so happened that you",1984,"Orwell, George"
1726,"wanted to buy it, thatd cost you four dollars. I can remember when a thing
like that would have fetched eight pounds, and eight pounds was--well, I
cant work it out, but it was a lot of money. But who cares about genuine",1984,"Orwell, George"
1727,antiques nowadays--even the few thats left?,1984,"Orwell, George"
1728,Winston immediately paid over the four dollars and slid the coveted thing,1984,"Orwell, George"
1729,into his pocket. What appealed to him about it was not so much its beauty,1984,"Orwell, George"
1730,as the air it seemed to possess of belonging to an age quite different,1984,"Orwell, George"
1731,"from the present one. The soft, rainwatery glass was not like any glass",1984,"Orwell, George"
1732,that he had ever seen. The thing was doubly attractive because of its,1984,"Orwell, George"
1733,"apparent uselessness, though he could guess that it must once have been",1984,"Orwell, George"
1734,"intended as a paperweight. It was very heavy in his pocket, but fortunately",1984,"Orwell, George"
1735,"it did not make much of a bulge. It was a queer thing, even a compromising",1984,"Orwell, George"
1736,"thing, for a Party member to have in his possession. Anything old, and for",1984,"Orwell, George"
1737,"that matter anything beautiful, was always vaguely suspect. The old man had",1984,"Orwell, George"
1738,grown noticeably more cheerful after receiving the four dollars. Winston,1984,"Orwell, George"
1739,realized that he would have accepted three or even two.,1984,"Orwell, George"
1740,"Theres another room upstairs that you might care to take a look at, he
said. Theres not much in it. Just a few pieces. Well do with a light if",1984,"Orwell, George"
1741,were going upstairs.,1984,"Orwell, George"
1742,"He lit another lamp, and, with bowed back, led the way slowly up the",1984,"Orwell, George"
1743,"steep and worn stairs and along a tiny passage, into a room which did",1984,"Orwell, George"
1744,not give on the street but looked out on a cobbled yard and a forest of,1984,"Orwell, George"
1745,chimney-pots. Winston noticed that the furniture was still arranged as,1984,"Orwell, George"
1746,though the room were meant to be lived in. There was a strip of carpet on,1984,"Orwell, George"
1747,"the floor, a picture or two on the walls, and a deep, slatternly arm-chair",1984,"Orwell, George"
1748,drawn up to the fireplace. An old-fashioned glass clock with a twelve-hour,1984,"Orwell, George"
1749,"face was ticking away on the mantelpiece. Under the window, and occupying",1984,"Orwell, George"
1750,"nearly a quarter of the room, was an enormous bed with the mattress still",1984,"Orwell, George"
1751,on it.,1984,"Orwell, George"
1752,"We lived here till my wife died, said the old man half apologetically.",1984,"Orwell, George"
1753,"Im selling the furniture off by little and little. Now thats a beautiful
mahogany bed, or at least it would be if you could get the bugs out of it.
But I dare say youd find it a little bit cumbersome.

He was holding the lamp high up, so as to illuminate the whole room, and
in the warm dim light the place looked curiously inviting. The thought
flitted through Winstons mind that it would probably be quite easy to",1984,"Orwell, George"
1754,"rent the room for a few dollars a week, if he dared to take the risk. It",1984,"Orwell, George"
1755,"was a wild, impossible notion, to be abandoned as soon as thought of; but",1984,"Orwell, George"
1756,"the room had awakened in him a sort of nostalgia, a sort of ancestral",1984,"Orwell, George"
1757,memory. It seemed to him that he knew exactly what it felt like to sit in,1984,"Orwell, George"
1758,"a room like this, in an arm-chair beside an open fire with your feet in",1984,"Orwell, George"
1759,"the fender and a kettle on the hob; utterly alone, utterly secure, with",1984,"Orwell, George"
1760,"nobody watching you, no voice pursuing you, no sound except the singing",1984,"Orwell, George"
1761,of the kettle and the friendly ticking of the clock.,1984,"Orwell, George"
1762,"Theres no telescreen! he could not help murmuring.

Ah, said the old man, I never had one of those things. Too expensive.",1984,"Orwell, George"
1763,"And I never seemed to feel the need of it, somehow. Now thats a nice
gateleg table in the corner there. Though of course youd have to put new",1984,"Orwell, George"
1764,"hinges on it if you wanted to use the flaps.

There was a small bookcase in the other corner, and Winston had already
gravitated towards it. It contained nothing but rubbish. The hunting-down
and destruction of books had been done with the same thoroughness in the
prole quarters as everywhere else. It was very unlikely that there existed
anywhere in Oceania a copy of a book printed earlier than 1960. The old
man, still carrying the lamp, was standing in front of a picture in a
rosewood frame which hung on the other side of the fireplace, opposite
the bed.

Now, if you happen to be interested in old prints at all---- he began
delicately.

Winston came across to examine the picture. It was a steel engraving of an
oval building with rectangular windows, and a small tower in front. There
was a railing running round the building, and at the rear end there was
what appeared to be a statue. Winston gazed at it for some moments. It
seemed vaguely familiar, though he did not remember the statue.

The frames fixed to the wall, said the old man, but I could unscrew it
for you, I dare say.",1984,"Orwell, George"
1765,"I know that building, said Winston finally. Its a ruin now. Its in
the middle of the street outside the Palace of Justice.",1984,"Orwell, George"
1766,"Thats right. Outside the Law Courts. It was bombed in--oh, many years",1984,"Orwell, George"
1767,"ago. It was a church at one time, St Clement Danes, its name was. He
smiled apologetically, as though conscious of saying something slightly
ridiculous, and added: Oranges and lemons, say the bells of St Clements!",1984,"Orwell, George"
1768,"Whats that? said Winston.

Oh--Oranges and lemons, say the bells of St Clement's. That was a rhyme",1984,"Orwell, George"
1769,"we had when I was a little boy. How it goes on I dont remember, but I do
know it ended up, ""Here comes a candle to light you to bed, Here comes a
chopper to chop off your head."" It was a kind of a dance. They held out
their arms for you to pass under, and when they came to ""Here comes a
chopper to chop off your head"" they brought their arms down and caught you.
It was just names of churches. All the London churches were in it--all the
principal ones, that is.",1984,"Orwell, George"

1773,"Two pieces of yesterday were in Captain David-sons mind when he woke, and he lay
looking at diem in die darkness for a while. One up: the new shipload of women had
arrived. Believe it or not. They were here, in Centralville, twenty-seven light years from
Earth by NAFAL and four hours from Smith Camp by hopper, the second batch of
breeding females for the New Tahiti Colony, all sound and clean, 212 head of prime
human stock. Or prime enough, anyhow. One down: the report from Dump Island of
crop failures, massive erosion, a wipe-out. The line of 212 buxom beddable breasty
little figures faded from Davidsons mind as he saw rain pouring down onto ploughed",The Word for World is Forest,"Le Guin, Ursula K"
1774,"dirt, churning it to mud, thinning the mud to a red broth that ran down rocks into the",The Word for World is Forest,"Le Guin, Ursula K"
1775,"rain beaten sea. The erosion had begun before he left Dump Island to run Smith Camp,",The Word for World is Forest,"Le Guin, Ursula K"
1776,"and being gifted with an exceptional visual memory, the kind they called eidetic, he",The Word for World is Forest,"Le Guin, Ursula K"
1777,could recall it now all too clearly. It looked like that big dome Kees was right and you,The Word for World is Forest,"Le Guin, Ursula K"
1778,"had to leave a lot of trees standing where you planned to put farms. But he still couldnt
see why a soybean farm needed to waste a lot of space on trees if the land was
managed really scientifically. It wasnt like that in Ohio; if you wanted corn you grew",The Word for World is Forest,"Le Guin, Ursula K"
1779,"corn, and no space wasted on trees and stuff. But then Earth was a tamed planet and",The Word for World is Forest,"Le Guin, Ursula K"
1780,New Tahiti wasnt. Thats what he was here for: to tame it. If Dump Island was just,The Word for World is Forest,"Le Guin, Ursula K"
1781,"rocks and gullies now, then scratch it; start over on a new island and do better. Cant
keep us down, were Men. Youll learn. what that means pretty soon, you godforsaken
damn planet, Davidson thought, and he grinned a little in the darkness of the hut, for
he liked challenges. Thinking Men, he thought Women, and again the line of little
figures began to sway through his mind, smiling, jiggling.
""Ben!"" he roared, sitting up and swinging his bare feet onto the bare floor. ""Hot water
get-ready, hurry-up-quick!' The roar woke him satisfyingly. He stretched and scratched

his chest and pulled on his shorts and strode out of the hut into the sunlit clearing all in
one easy series of motions. A big, hard-muscled man, he enjoyed using his well-trained
body. Ben, his creechie, had the water ready and steaming over the fire* as usual, and
was squatting staring at nothing, as usual. Creechies never slept, they just sat and
stared. ""Breakfast. Hurry-up-quick!"" Davidson said, picking up his razor from the rough
board
table where the creechie had laid it out ready with a towel and a propped-up mirror.
There was a lot to be done today, since hed decided, that last minute before getting",The Word for World is Forest,"Le Guin, Ursula K"
1782,"up, to fly down to Central and see the new women for himself. They wouldnt last long,
among over two thousand men, and like the first batch probably most of them were
Colony Brides, and only twenty or thirty had come as Recreation Staff, but those babies
were real good greedy girls and he intended to be first in line with at least one of them
this time. He grinned on the left, the right cheek remaining stiff to the whining razor.
The old creechie was moseying round taking an hour to bring his breakfast from the
cookhouse. ""Hurry-up-quick!"" Davidson yelled, and Ben pushed his boneless saunter
into a walk. Ben was about a meter high and his back fur was more white man green;
he was old, and dumb even for a creechie, but Davidson knew how to handle them; he
could tame any of them, if it was worm the effort. It wasnt, though. Get enough",The Word for World is Forest,"Le Guin, Ursula K"
1783,"humans here, build machines and robots, make farms and cities, and nobody would",The Word for World is Forest,"Le Guin, Ursula K"
1784,"need the creechies any more. And a good thing too. For this world, New Tahiti, was",The Word for World is Forest,"Le Guin, Ursula K"
1785,"literally made for men. Cleaned up and cleaned out, the dark forests cut down for open",The Word for World is Forest,"Le Guin, Ursula K"
1786,"fields of grain, the primeval murk and savagery and ignorance wiped out, it would be a",The Word for World is Forest,"Le Guin, Ursula K"

1788,"For thats
what Don Davidson was, way down deep inside him: a world-tamer. He wasnt a",The Word for World is Forest,"Le Guin, Ursula K"
1789,"boastful man, but he knew his own size. It just happened to be the way he was made.",The Word for World is Forest,"Le Guin, Ursula K"
1790,"He knew what he wanted, and how to get it. And he always got it.",The Word for World is Forest,"Le Guin, Ursula K"
1791,"Breakfast landed warm in his belly. His good mood wasnt spoiled even by the sight of
Kees Van Slen coming towards him, fat, white, and worried, his eyes sticking out like
blue golf-balls.
""Don,"" Kees said without greeting, ""the loggers have been hunting red deer in the
Strips again. There are eighteen pair of antlers in the back room of the Lounge.""
""Nobody ever stopped poachers from poaching, Kees.""
""You can stop them. Thats why we live under martial law, thats why the Army runs
this colony. To keep the laws.""
A frontal attack from Fatty Bigdome! It was almost funny. ""All right, ""Davidson said
reasonably, ""I could stop em. But look, its the men Im looking after; thats my job, like
you said. And its the men mat count. Not the animals. If a little extra-legal hunting",The Word for World is Forest,"Le Guin, Ursula K"
1792,"helps the men get through this godforsaken life, men I intend to blink. Theyve got to
have some recreation.""
""They have games, sports, hobbies, films, teletapes of every major sporting event of
the past century, liquor, marijuana, bailies, and a fresh batch of women at Central, for
those unsatisfied by the Armys rather unimaginative arrangements",The Word for World is Forest,"Le Guin, Ursula K"
1793,"for hygienic homosexuality. They are spoiled rotten, your frontier heroes, and they",The Word for World is Forest,"Le Guin, Ursula K"
1794,"dont need to exterminate a rare native species for recreation. If you dont act, I must",The Word for World is Forest,"Le Guin, Ursula K"
1795,"record a major infraction of Ecological Protocols in my report to Captain Godde.
You can do mat if you see fit, Kees, said Davidson, who never lost his temper. It was
sort of pathetic the way a euro like Kees got all red in the face when he lost control of
his emotions. ' Thats your job, after all. I wont hold it against you; they can do the",The Word for World is Forest,"Le Guin, Ursula K"
1796,"arguing at Central and decide whos right. See, you want to keep this place just like it
is, actually, Kees. Like one big National Forest. To look at, to study. Great, youre a",The Word for World is Forest,"Le Guin, Ursula K"

needs it bad. We find wood on New Tahiti. Soîwere loggers. See, where we differ is",The Word for World is Forest,"Le Guin, Ursula K"
1798,"that with you Earth doesnt come first, actually. With me it does.""
Kees looked at him sideways out of those blue golf-ball eyes. ""Does it? You want to
make this world into Earths image, eh? A desert of cement?
When I say Earth, Kees, I mean people. Men. You worry about deer and trees and",The Word for World is Forest,"Le Guin, Ursula K"
1799,"fibre weed, fine, thats your thing. But I like to see things in perspective, from the top
down, and the top, so far, is humans. Were here, now; and so this worlds going to go
our way. Like it or not, its a",The Word for World is Forest,"Le Guin, Ursula K"
1800,"fact you have to face; it happens to be the way things are. Listen, Kees, Im going to
hop down to Central and take a look at the new colonists! Want to come along?*",The Word for World is Forest,"Le Guin, Ursula K"
1801,"No thanks, Captain Davidson, the spesh said, going on towards the Lab hut. He was",The Word for World is Forest,"Le Guin, Ursula K"
1802,"really mad. All upset about those damn deer. They were great animals, all right.",The Word for World is Forest,"Le Guin, Ursula K"
1803,"Davidsons vivid memory recalled the first one he had seen, here on Smith Land, a big",The Word for World is Forest,"Le Guin, Ursula K"
1804,"red shadow, two meters at the shoulder, a crown of narrow golden antlers, a fleet,",The Word for World is Forest,"Le Guin, Ursula K"
1805,"brave beast, the finest game-animal imaginable. Back on Earth they were using",The Word for World is Forest,"Le Guin, Ursula K"
1806,"robodeer even in the High Rockies and Himalaya Parks now, the real ones were about",The Word for World is Forest,"Le Guin, Ursula K"
1807,"gone. These things were a hunters dream. So theyd be hunted. Hell, even the wild",The Word for World is Forest,"Le Guin, Ursula K"
1808,"creechies hunted them, with their lousy little bows. The deer would be hunted because",The Word for World is Forest,"Le Guin, Ursula K"
1809,thats what they were there for. But poor old bleeding-heart Kees couldnt see it. He,The Word for World is Forest,"Le Guin, Ursula K"
1810,"was actually a smart fellow, but not realistic, not tough-minded enough. He didnt see
that youve got to play on the winning side or else you lose. And its Man that wins,
every time. The old Conquistador.
Davidson strode on through the settlement, morning sunlight in his eyes, the smell of
sawn wood and woodsmoke sweet on the warm air. Things looked pretty neat, for a
logging camp. The two hundred men here had tamed a fair patch of wilderness in just
three E-months. Smith Camp: a couple of big corruplast geodesies, forty timber huts
built by creechie-tabor, the sawmill,

the burner trailing a blue plume over acres of logs and cut lumber; uphill, the airfield
and the big prefab hangar for helicopters and heavy machinery. That was all. But when
they came here there had been nothing. Trees. A dark huddle and jumble and tangle of
trees, endless, meaningless. A sluggish river overhung and choked by trees, a few
creechie-warrens hidden among the trees, some red deer, hairy monkeys, birds. And
trees. Roots, boles, branches, twigs, leaves overhead and underfoot and in your face
and in your eyes, endless leaves on endless trees.
New Tahiti was mostly water, warm shallow seas broken here and there by reefs, islets,
archipelagoes, and the five big Lands that lay in a 2500-kilo arc across the Northwest
Quarter-sphere. And all those flecks and blobs of land were covered with trees. Ocean:
forest. That was your choice on New Tahiti. Water and sunlight, or darkness and
leaves.
But men were here now to end the darkness, and turn the tree-jumble into clean sawn
planks, more prized on Earth than gold. Literally, he-cause gold could be got from
seawater and from under the Antarctic ice, but wood could not; wood came only from
trees. And it was a really necessary luxury on Earth. So the alien forests became wood.
Two hundred men with robosaws and haulers had already cut eight mile-wide Strips on
Smith Land, in three months. The stumps of the Strip nearest camp were already white
and punky; chemically treated, they would have fallen into fertile ash by the time the
permanent colonists, the
-fanners, came to settle Smith Land. All the farmers would have to do was plant seeds
and let em sprout.",The Word for World is Forest,"Le Guin, Ursula K"
1811,"It had been done once before. That was a queer thing, and the proof, actually, that",The Word for World is Forest,"Le Guin, Ursula K"
1812,New Tahiti was intended for humans to take over. All the stuff here had come from,The Word for World is Forest,"Le Guin, Ursula K"
1813,"Earth, about a million years ago, and the evolution had followed so close a path that",The Word for World is Forest,"Le Guin, Ursula K"
1814,"you recognized things at once: pine, oak, walnut, chestnut, fir, holly, apple, ash; deer,",The Word for World is Forest,"Le Guin, Ursula K"
1815,"bird, mouse, cat squirrel, monkey. The hu-manoids on Hain-Davenant of course claimed",The Word for World is Forest,"Le Guin, Ursula K"
1816,"theyd done it at the same time as they colonized Earth, but if you listened to those ETs

youd find they claimed to have settled every planet in the Galaxy and invented",The Word for World is Forest,"Le Guin, Ursula K"
1817,everything from sex to thumbtacks. The theories about Atlantis were a lot more,The Word for World is Forest,"Le Guin, Ursula K"
1818,"realistic, and this might well be a lost Atlantean colony. But the humans had died out.",The Word for World is Forest,"Le Guin, Ursula K"
1819,And the nearest thing that had developed from the monkey line to replace them was,The Word for World is Forest,"Le Guin, Ursula K"

They leaned their backsides on a split rail fence. Davidson lit his first reefer of the day.
Sunlight, smoke-blued, slanted warm across the air. The forest behind camp, a quartermile-wide uncut strip, was full of the faint, ceaseless, cracking, chuckling, stirring,
whirring, silvery noises that woods in the morning are full of. It might have been Idaho

sooner. It's just how things happen to be. Primitive races always have to give way to

1869,"Grinning, Davidson went on up to the hangar. As he brought the helicopter back over",The Word for World is Forest,"Le Guin, Ursula K"
1870,"camp he looked down at it: kids blocks, sketch-tines of paths, long stump-stubbled
clearings, all shrinking as the machine rose and he saw the green of the uncut forests
of the great island, and beyond that dark green the pale green of the sea going on and
on. Now Smith Camp looked like a yellow spot, a fleck on a vast green tapestry.
He crossed Smith Straits and the wooded, deep-folded ranges of north Central Island,
and came down by noon in Centralville. It looked like a city, at least after three months
in the woods; there were real streets, real buildings, it had been mere since the Colony
began four years ago. You didnt see what a flimsy little frontier-town it really was, until",The Word for World is Forest,"Le Guin, Ursula K"
1871,you looked south of it a half-mile and saw glittering above the stumplands and the,The Word for World is Forest,"Le Guin, Ursula K"

a big one but it looked so big, here. And it was only a launch, a lander, a ships boat;",The Word for World is Forest,"Le Guin, Ursula K"
1873,"the NAFAL ship of the line, Shackle ton, was half a million kilos up, in orbit. The launch",The Word for World is Forest,"Le Guin, Ursula K"

1878,he was made.,The Word for World is Forest,"Le Guin, Ursula K"
1879,"Soon enough, walking down those frontier-town streets with their wide vistas of",The Word for World is Forest,"Le Guin, Ursula K"
1880,"nothing much at each end, he began to smile. For the, women were there, all right, and",The Word for World is Forest,"Le Guin, Ursula K"
1881,you could tell they were fresh ones. They mostly had long tight skirts and big shoes like,The Word for World is Forest,"Le Guin, Ursula K"

1883,"Fashions had changed; too bad. They all wore their hair piled up high, it must be",The Word for World is Forest,"Le Guin, Ursula K"
1884,"sprayed with that glue stuff they used. Ugly as hell, but it was the sort of thing only",The Word for World is Forest,"Le Guin, Ursula K"
1885,"women would do to their hair, and so it was provocative., Davidson grinned at a chesty",The Word for World is Forest,"Le Guin, Ursula K"
1886,"little euraf with more oak than head; he got no smile, but a wag of the retreating hips",The Word for World is Forest,"Le Guin, Ursula K"
1887,"that said plainly, Follow follow follow me. But he didnt. Not yet. He went to Central HQ:
quickstone and plastiplate Standard Issue, 40 offices, 10 watercoolers and a basement
arsenal, and checked in with New Tahiti Central Colonial Administration Command. He
met a couple of the launch-crew, put in a request for a new semirobo bark-stripper at
Forestry, and got his old pal Juju Sereng to meet him at the Luau Bar at fourteen
hundred.
He got to the bar an hour early to stock up on a little food before the drinking began.
Lyubov was
14

there, sitting with a couple of guys in Fleet uniform, some kind of speshes that had
come down on the Shackle ton& launch. Davidson didnt have a high regard for the
Navy, a lot of fancy sunhoppers who left the dirty, muddy, dangerous on-planet work to
the Army; but brass was brass, and anyhow it was funny to see Lyubov acting chummy
with anybody in uniform. He was talking, waving his hands around the way be did. Just
in passing Davidson tapped his shoulder and said, ""Hi, Raj old pal, hows tricks? He
went on without waiting for the scowl, though he hated to miss it. It was really funny
the way Lyubov hated him. Probably the guy was effeminate like a lot of intellectuals,
and resented David-son's virility. Anyhow Davidson wasn't going to waste any time
hating Lyubov, he wasn't worth the trouble.
The Luau served a first-rate venison steak. What would they say on old Earth if they
saw one man eating a kilogram of meat at one meal? Poor damn soybeansuckers! Then
Juju arrived withî as Davidson had confidently expectedîthe pick of the new Collie
Girls: two fruity beauties, not Brides, but Recreation Staff. Oh the old Colonial
Administration sometimes came through! It was a long, hot afternoon.
Flying back to camp he crossed Smith Straits level with the sun that lay on top of a
great gold bed of haze over the sea. He sang as he lolled in the pilot's seat. Smith Land
came in sight hazy, and there was smoke over the camp, a dark
15

smudge as if oil had got into the waste-burner, He couldn't even make out the buildings
through it. It was only as he dropped down to the landing-field that be saw the charred
jet, the wrecked hoppers, the burned-out hangar.
He pulled the hopper up again and flew back over the camp, so low that he might have
hit the high cone of the burner, the only thing left sticking up. The rest was gone, mill,
furnace, lumberyards, HQ, huts, barracks, creechie compound, everything. Black hulks
and wrecks, still smoking. But it hadn't been a forest fire. The forest stood there, green,
next to the ruins. David-son swung back round to the field, set down and lit out looking
for the motorbike, but it too was a black wreck along with the stinking, smoldering ruins
of the hangar and the machinery. He loped down the path to camp. As he passed what
had been the radio hut, his mind snapped back into gear. Without hesitating for even a
stride he changed course, off the path, behind the gutted shack. There he stopped. He
listened.
There was nobody. It was all silent. The fires had been out a long time; only the great
lumber-piles still smoldered, showing a hot red under the ash and char. Worth more
than gold, those oblong ash-heaps had been. But no smoke rose from the black
skeletons of the barracks and huts; and there were bones among the ashes.
Davidson's brain was super-clear and active, now, as he crouched behind the radio
shack. There were two possibilities. One: an attack from
16

another camp. Some officer on King or New Java had gone spla and was trying a coup
de plane te. Two: an attack from off-planet. He s£w the golden tower on the spacedock at Central. But if the Shackleton had gone privateer why would she start by
rubbing out a small camp, instead of taking over Centralville? No, it must be invasion,
aliens. Some unknown race, or maybe the Cetians or the Hainish had decided to move
in on Earth's colonies. He'd never trusted those damned smart humanoids. This must
have been done with a heatbomb. The invading force, with jets, air-cars, nukes, could
easily be hidden on an island or reef anywhere in the SW Quartersphere. He must get
back to his hopper and send out the alarm, then try a look around, reconnoiter, so he
could tell HQ his assessment of the actual situation. He was just straightening up when
he heard the voices.
Not human voices. High, soft, gabble-gobble. Aliens.
Ducking on hands and knees behind the shack's plastic roof, which lay on the ground
deformed by heat into a batwing shape, he held still and listened.
Four creechies walked by a few yards from him, on the path. They were wild creechies,
naked except for loose leather belts on which knives and pouches hung. None wore the
shorts and leather collar supplied to tame creechies. The Volunteers in the compound
must have been incinerated along with the humans.
17

They stopped a little way past his hiding place, talking their slow gabble-gobble, and
Davidson held his breath. He didn't want them to spot him. What the devil were
creechies doing here? They could only be serving as spies and scouts for the invaders.
One pointed south as it talked, and turned, so that Davidson saw its face. And he
recognized it. Creechies all looked alike, but this one was different. He had written his
own signature all over that face, less man a year ago. It was the one that had gone
spla and attacked him down in Central, the homicidal one, Lyubov's pet. What in the
blue hell was it doing here?
Davidson*s mind raced, clicked; reactions fast as always, he stood up, sudden, tall,
easy, gun in hand. You creechies. Stop. Stay-put. No moving!
His voice cracked out like a whiplash. The four little green creatures did not move. The
one with the smashed-in face looked at him across the black rubble with huge, blank
eyes that had no light in them.
Answer now. This fire, who start it?
No answer.
Answer now: hurry-up-quick! No answer, then I burn-up first one, then one, then one,",The Word for World is Forest,"Le Guin, Ursula K"
1888,"see? This fire, who start it?
We burned the camp, Captain Davidson, said the one from Central, in a queer soft
voice that reminded Davidson of some human. The humans are all dead.
18

You burned it, what do you mean?
He could not recall Scarf ace's name for some reason.
' 'There were two hundred humans here. Ninety slaves of my people. Nine hundred of
my people came out of the forest. First we killed the humans in the place in the forest
where they were cutting trees, then we killed those in this place, while the houses were
burning. I had thought you were killed. I am glad to see you, Captain Davidson.",The Word for World is Forest,"Le Guin, Ursula K"
1889,"It was all crazy, and of course a lie. They couldnt have killed all of mem, Ok, Birno, Van
Sten, all the rest, two hundred men, some of them would have got out. All the
creechies had was bows and arrows. Anyway the creechies couldnt have done this.",The Word for World is Forest,"Le Guin, Ursula K"
1890,"Creechies didnt fight, didnt kill, didnt have wars. They were intraspecies nonaggressive, that meant sitting ducks. They didnt fight back. They sure as hell didnt
massacre two hundred men at a swipe. It was crazy. The silence, the faint stink of
burning in the long, warm evening light, the pale-green faces with unmoving eyes that
watched him, it all added up to nothing, to a crazy bad dream, a nightmare.
""Who did this for you?""
""Nine hundred of my people,"" Scarf ace said in that damned fake-human voice.
* *No, not that. Who else? Who were you acting for? Who told you what to do?""
""My wife did.""

He was down on his back, pinned down, disarmed. Four green muzzles looked down at
him. The scarfaced one was still singing, a breathless gabble, but with a tune to it. The
other three listened, their white teeth showing in grins. He had never seen a creechie
smile. He had never looked up into a creechies face from below. Always down, from",The Word for World is Forest,"Le Guin, Ursula K"

1910,They let him go.,The Word for World is Forest,"Le Guin, Ursula K"
1911,"He got up cautiously, still dizzy from the fall Scarface had given him. The creechies",The Word for World is Forest,"Le Guin, Ursula K"
1912,"stood well away from him now, knowing his reach was twice theirs; but Scarface wasnt
the only one armed, there was a second gun pointing at his guts. That was Ben holding
the gun. His own creechie Ben, the little grey mangy bastard, looking stupid as always
but holding a gun.

1913,walking towards the field.,The Word for World is Forest,"Le Guin, Ursula K"
1914,"A voice behind him said some creechie word, shrill and loud. Another said, Hurry-upquick! and there was a queer noise like birds twittering that must be creechie laughter.",The Word for World is Forest,"Le Guin, Ursula K"
1915,"A shot clapped and whined on the road right by him. Christ, it wasnt fair, they had the
guns and he wasnt armed. He began to run. He could outrun any creechie. They didnt
know how to shoot a gun.
""Run,"" said the quiet voice far behind him. That was Scarface. Selver, that was his
name. Sam, theyd called him, till Lyubov stopped Davidson from giving him what he",The Word for World is Forest,"Le Guin, Ursula K"
1916,"deserved and made a pet out of him, then theyd called him Selver. Christ, what was all
this, it was a night21

mare. He ran. The blood thundered in his ears. He ran through the golden, smoky
evening. There was a body by the path, he hadnt even noticed it coming. It wasnt
burned, it looked like a white balloon with the air gone out. It had staring blue eyes.
They didnt dare kin him, Davidson. They hadnt shot at him again. It was impossible.
They couldnt kill him. There was the hopper, safe and shining, and he lunged into the",The Word for World is Forest,"Le Guin, Ursula K"
1917,"seat and had her up before the creechies could try anything. His hands shook, but not",The Word for World is Forest,"Le Guin, Ursula K"
1918,"much, just shock. They couldnt kill nun. He circled the hill and then came back fast and
low, looking for the four creechies. But nothing moved in the streaky rubble of the
camp.
There had been a camp there this morning. Two-hundred men. There had been four
creechies there. just now. He hadnt dreamed all mis. They couldnt just disappear.
They were there, hiding. He opened up the machinegun in the hoppers nose and raked",The Word for World is Forest,"Le Guin, Ursula K"
1919,"the burned ground, shot holes in the green leaves of the forest, strafed the burned",The Word for World is Forest,"Le Guin, Ursula K"
1920,bones and cold bodies of his men and the wrecked machinery and the rotting white,The Word for World is Forest,"Le Guin, Ursula K"
1921,"stumps, returning again and again until the ammo was gone and the guns spasms
stopped short.
Davidsons hands were steady now, his body felt appeased, and he knew he wasnt
caught in any dream. He headed back over the Straits, to take the news to Centralville.
As he flew he could feel his face relax into its usual calm lines. They couldnt blame the",The Word for World is Forest,"Le Guin, Ursula K"
1922,"disaster on him, for be hadnt
22

even been there. Maybe theyd see that it was significant that the creechies had struck",The Word for World is Forest,"Le Guin, Ursula K"
1923,"while he Was gone, knowing theyd fail if he was there to organize the defense. And
there was one good thing would come out of this. Theyd do like they should have done",The Word for World is Forest,"Le Guin, Ursula K"
1924,"to start with, and clean up the planet for human occupation. Not even Lyubov could",The Word for World is Forest,"Le Guin, Ursula K"
1925,"stop them from rubbing out the creechies now, not when they heard it was Lyubovs
pet creechie whod led the massacre! Theyd go in for rat-extermination for a while,
now; and maybe, just maybe, theyd hand that little job over to him! At that thought he",The Word for World is Forest,"Le Guin, Ursula K"
1926,"could have smiled. But he kept his face calm.
The sea under him was greyish with twilight, and ahead of him lay the island hills, the
deep-folded, many-streamed, many-leaved forests in the dusk.

Chapter Two

ALL the colors of rust and sunset, brown-reds and pale greens, changed ceaselessly in
the long leaves as the wind blew. The roots of the cooper willows, thick and ridged,
were moss-green down by the running water, which like the wind moved slowly with
many soft eddies and seeming pauses, held back by rocks, roots, hanging and fallen
leaves. No way was clear, no light unbroken, in the forest. Into wind, water, sunlight,
starlight, there always entered leaf and branch, bole and root, the shadowy, the
complex. Little paths ran under the branches, around the boles, over the roots; they did
not go straight, but yielded to every obstacle, devious as nerves. The ground was not
dry and solid but damp and rather springy, product of the collaboration of living things
with the long, elaborate death of leaves and trees; and from that rich graveyard grew
ninety-foot trees, and tiny mushrooms that sprouted in circles half an inch across. The
smell of the air
25

was subtle, various, and sweet. The view was never long, unless looking up through the
branches you caught sight of the stars. Nothing was pure, dry, arid, plain. Revelation
was lacking. There was no seeing everything at once: no certainty. The colors of rust
and sunset kept changing in the hanging leaves of the copper willows, and you could
not say even whether the leaves of the willows were brownish-red, or reddish-green, or
green.
Selver came up a path beside the water, going slowly and often stumbling on the willow
roots. He saw an old man dreaming, and stopped. The old man looked at him through
the long willow-leaves and saw him in his dreams.
""May I come to your Lodge, my Lord Dreamer? Ive come a long way.
The old man sat still. Presently Selver squatted down on his heels just off the path,
beside the stream. His head drooped down, for he was worn out and had to sleep. He
had been walking five days.
Are you of the dream-time or of the world-time?* the old man asked at last.
-Of the world-time.""
* Come along with me men.f The old man got up promptly and led Selver up the
wandering path out of the willow grove into dryer, darker regions of oak and thorn.
""Itookyouforagod,""hesaid, going a pace ahead. ""And it seemed to me I had seen you
before, perhaps in dream.""
26

""Not in the world-time. I come from Sornol, I have never been here before.""
""This town is Cadast. I am Coro Mena. Of the Whitethorn.""
""Selver is my name. Of the Ash.""
""There are Ash people among us, both men and women. Also your marriage-clans,
Birch and Holly; we have no women of the Apple. But you dont come looking for a",The Word for World is Forest,"Le Guin, Ursula K"
1927,"wife, do you?
My wife is dead, Selver said.
They came to the Men's Lodge, on high ground in a stand of young oaks. They stooped
and crawled through the tunnel-entrance. Inside, in
¢the firelight, the old man stood up, but Selver stayed crouching on hands and knees,
unable to rise. Now that help and comfort was at hand his body, which he had forced
too far, would not go farther. It lay down and the eyes closed; and Selver slipped, with
relief and gratitude, into the great darkness.
The men of the Lodge of Cadast looked after him, and their healer came to tend the
wound in his right arm. In the night Coro Mena and the healer Torber sat by the fire.
Most of the other men were with their wives that night; there were only a couple of
young prentice-dreamers over on the benches, and they had both gone fast asleep.
* *I don't know what would give a man such scars as he has on his face, said the",The Word for World is Forest,"Le Guin, Ursula K"
1928,"healer, and much less, such a wound as that in his arm. A very queer wound.",The Word for World is Forest,"Le Guin, Ursula K"
1929,27,The Word for World is Forest,"Le Guin, Ursula K"
1930,"It's a queer engine he wore on his belt/* said Coro Mena.
I saw it and didnt see it.""
""I put it under his bench. It looks like polished iron, but not like the handiwork of men.""
""He comes from Somol, he said to you/*
They were both silent a while. Coro Mena felt unreasoning fear press upon him, and
slipped into dream to find the reason for the fear; for he was an old man, and long
adept. In the dream the giants walked, heavy and dire. Their dry scaly limbs were
swathed in cloths; their eyes were little and light, like tin beads. Behind them crawled
huge moving things made of polished iron. The trees fell down in front of them.
Out from among the falling trees a man ran, crying aloud, with blood on his mouth. The
path he ran on was the doorpath of the Lodge of Cadast.
""Well, meres little doubt of it, Coro Mena said, sliding out of the dream. He came",The Word for World is Forest,"Le Guin, Ursula K"
1931,"oversea straight from Sornol, or else came afoot from the coast of Kelme Deva on our",The Word for World is Forest,"Le Guin, Ursula K"
1932,"own land. Hie giants are in both those places, travellers say.
Will they follow him, said Torber; neither answered the question, which was no
question but a statement of possibility.
You saw the giants once, Coro?
Once, the old man said.
He dreamed; sometimes, being very old and not so strong as he had been, he slipped
off to sleep for a while. Day broke, noon passed. Out28

side the Lodge a hunting-party went out, children chirped, women talked in voices like
running water. A dryer voice called Coro Mena from the door. He crawled out into the
evening sunlight. His sister stood outside, sniffing the aromatic wind with pleasure, but
looking stem all the same. Has the stranger waked up, Coro?
Not yet. Torbers looking after him.""
""We must hear his story.*",The Word for World is Forest,"Le Guin, Ursula K"
1933,"No doubt he'll wake soon.*'
Ebor Dendep frowned. Head woman of Cadast, she was anxious for her people; but she
did not want to ask that a hurt man be disturbed, nor to offend the Dreamers by
insisting on her right to enter their Lodge. Cantyouwakehim,Coro?"" she asked at last.
""What if he is . . . being pursued?""
He could not run his sisters emotions on the same rein with his own, yet he felt them;",The Word for World is Forest,"Le Guin, Ursula K"
1934,"her anxiety bit him. If Torber permits, I will, he said.",The Word for World is Forest,"Le Guin, Ursula K"
1935,"* Try to learn his news, quickly. I wish he was a woman and would talk sense. . . .""
The stranger had roused himself, and lay feverish in the half dark of the Lodge. The
unreined dreams of illness moved in his eyes. He sat up, however, and spoke with
control. As he listened Coro Menas bones seemed to shrink within him trying to hide",The Word for World is Forest,"Le Guin, Ursula K"
1936,"from this terrible story, this new thing.",The Word for World is Forest,"Le Guin, Ursula K"
1937,"I was Selver Thele, when I lived in Eshreth in Soruol. My city was destroyed by the
yumens
29

when they cut down the trees in that region. I was one of those made to serve them,
with my wife Thele. She was raped by one of them and died. I attacked the yumen that
killed her. He would have killed me then, but another of them saved me and set me
free. I left Sornol, where no town is safe from the yumens now, and came here to the
North Isle, and lived on the coast of Kelme Deva in the Red Groves. TTiere presently
the yumens came and began to cut down the world. They destroyed a city there, Penle.
They caught a hundred of the men and women and made them serve them, and live hi
the pen. I was not caught. I lived with others who had escaped from Penle, in the bogland north of Kelme Deva. Sometimes at night I went among the people in the yumen's
pens. They told me that one was there. That one whom I had tried to kill. I thought at
first to try again; or else to set the people in the pen free. But all the time I watched
the trees fall and saw the world cut open and left to rot. The men might have escaped,
but the women were locked in more safely and could not, and they were beginning to
die. I talked with the people hiding there in the boglands. We were all very frightened
and very angry, and had no way to let our fear and anger free. So at last after long
talking, and long dreaming, and the making of a plan, we went in daylight, and killed
the yumens of Kelme Deva with arrows and hunting-lances, and burned their city and
their engines. We left nothing. But that one had gone away. He

came back alone. I sang over him, and let him
go.",The Word for World is Forest,"Le Guin, Ursula K"

1939,"Then, Coro Mena whispered.",The Word for World is Forest,"Le Guin, Ursula K"
1940,"Then a flying ship came from Somol, and hunted us in the forest, but found nobody.
So they set fire to the forest; but it rained, and they did little harm. Most of the people
freed from the pens and the others have gone farther norm and east, towards the Holle
Hills, for we were afraid many yumens might come hunting us. I went alone. The
yumens know me, you see, they know my face; and this frightens me, and those I stay
with. ¢ What is your wound?'* Torber asked.
That one, he shot me with their kind of weapon; but I sang him down and let him go.
Alone you downed a giant? said Torber with a fierce grin, wishing to believe.
Not alone. With three hunters, and with his weapon in my handîthis.
Torber drew back from the thing.
None of them spoke for a while. At last Coro Mena said, What you tell us is very black,",The Word for World is Forest,"Le Guin, Ursula K"

Yes. 
Do you weave and shape, direct and follow, start and cease at will?
Sometimes, not always.
Can you walk the road your dream goes?
Sometimes. Sometimes I am afraid to.
Who is not? It is not altogether bad with you, Seiver.
No, it is altogether bad, Seiver said, theres nothing good left,"" and he began to
shake.

had the headwomans question to ask; reluctantly he did so, kneeling by the sick man.",The Word for World is Forest,"Le Guin, Ursula K"

with these creatures, then? They look like men and talk like men, are they not men? I don't know. Do men kill men, except in madness? Does any beast kill its own kind?
Only the insects. These yumens kill us as lightly as we kill snakes. The one who taught
me said that they kill one another, in quarrels, and also in groups, like ants fighting. I
haven't seen that. But I know they don't spare one who asks life. They will strike a
bowed neck, I have seen it! There is a wish to kill in them, and therefore I saw fit to
put them to death.",The Word for World is Forest,"Le Guin, Ursula K"
1949,"And all men's dreams, said Coro Mena, crosslegged in shadow, will be changed. They
will never be the same again. I shall never walk again that path I came with you
yesterday, the way up from the willow grove that I've walked on all my life. It is
changed. You have walked on it and it is utterly changed. Before this day the thing we
had to do was the right thing to do; the way we had to go was the right way and led us
home. Where is our home now? For you've done what
33

you had to do, and it was not right. You have killed men. I saw mem, five years ago, in
the Lemgan Valley, where they came in a flying ship; I hid and watched the giants, six
of them,, and saw them speak, and look at rocks and plants, and cook food. They are
men. But you have lived among them, tell me, Selver: do they dream?",The Word for World is Forest,"Le Guin, Ursula K"

No. Sometimes they talk of their dreams, the healers try to use mem in healing, but",The Word for World is Forest,"Le Guin, Ursula K"

1952,"understood me when I snowed him how to dream, and yet even so be called the worldtime real* and the dream-time, unreal,as if that were the difference between them,""
""You have done what you had to do,"" Coro Mena repeated after a silence. His eyes met
Selvers, across shadows. The desperate tension lessened in Selvers face; his scarred
mouth relaxed, and belay back without saying more. In a little while he was asleep.

""Hes a god, Coro Mena said.
Torber nodded, accepting the old man's judgment almost with relief.
But not like the others. Not like the Pursuer, nor the Friend who has no face, nor the",The Word for World is Forest,"Le Guin, Ursula K"
1953,"Aspen-leaf Woman who walks in the forest of dreams. He is not the Gatekeeper, nor",The Word for World is Forest,"Le Guin, Ursula K"

1955,34,The Word for World is Forest,"Le Guin, Ursula K"
1956,he comes in the world-time like them. We may have dreamed of Selver these last few,The Word for World is Forest,"Le Guin, Ursula K"
1957,"years, but we shall no longer; he has left the dream-time. In the forest,.through the",The Word for World is Forest,"Le Guin, Ursula K"
1958,"forest he comes, where leaves fall, where trees fall, a god that knows death, a god that",The Word for World is Forest,"Le Guin, Ursula K"
1959,"kills and is not himself reborn.
The headwoman listened to Coro Mena's reports and prophecies, and acted. She put
the town of Cadast on alert, making sure that each family was ready to move out, with
some food packed, and litters ready for the old and ill. She sent young women scouting
south and east for news of the yumens. She kept one armed hunting-group always
around town, though the others went out as usual every night. And when Selver grew
stronger she insisted that he come out of the Lodge and tell his story: how the yumens
killed and enslaved people in Sornol, and cut down the forests; how the people of
Kelme Deva had killed the yumens. She forced women and undreaming men who did
not understand these things to listen again, until they understood, and were frightened.
For Ebor Dendep was a practical woman. When a Great Dreamer, her brother, told her
that Selver was a god, a changer, a bridge between realities, she believed and acted. It
was the Dreamer's responsibility to be careful, to be certain that his judgment was true.
Her responsibility was then to take that judgment and act upon it. He saw what must
be done; she saw that it was done.
All the cities of the forest must hear, Coro Mena said. So the headwoman sent out her
young
35

runners, and headwomen in other towns listened, and sent out their runners. The killing
at Kelme Deva and the name of Selver went over North Island and oversea to the other
lands, from voice to voice, or in writing; not very fast, for the Forest People had no
quicker messengers than footrun-ners; yet fast enough.
They were not all one people on the Forty Lands of the world. There were more
languages than lands, and each with a different dialect for every town that spoke it;
there were infinite ramifications of manners, morals, customs, crafts; physical types
differed on each of the five Great Lands. The people of Sornol were tall, and pale, and
great traders; the people of Rieshwel were short, and many had black fur, and they ate
monkeys, and so on and on. But the climate varied little, and the forest little, and sea
not at all. Curiosity, regular trade-routes, and the necessity of finding a husband or wife
of the proper Tree, kept up an easy movement of people among the towns and
between the lands, and so there were certain likenesses among all but the remotest
extremes, the half-rumored barbarian isles of the Far East and South. In all the Forty
Lands, women ran the cities and towns, and almost every town toad a Men's Lodge.
Within the Lodges the Dreamers spoke an old tongue, and this varied little from land to
land. It was rarely learned by women or by men who remained hunters, fishers,
weavers, builders, those who dreamed only small dreams outside the Lodge. As most
writing was in
36

this Lodge-tongue, when headwomen sent fleet girls carrying messages, the letters
went from Lodge to Lodge, and so were interpreted by the Dreamers to the Old
Women, as were other documents, rumors, problems, myths, and dreams. But it was
always the Old Women's choice whether to believe or not.
Selver was in a small room at Eshsen. The door was not locked, but he knew if he
opened it something bad would come in. So long as he kept it shut everything would be
all right. The trouble was that there were young trees, a sapling orchard, planted out in
front of the house; not fruit or nut trees but some other kind, he could not remember
what kind. He went out to see what kind of trees they were. They all lay broken and
uprooted. He picked up the silvery branch of one and a little blood ran out of the
broken end. No, not here, not again, Thele, he said: O Thele, come to me before your
death! But she did not come. Only her death was there, the broken birch tree, the
opened door. Selver turned and went quickly back into the house, discovering that it
was all built above ground like a yumen house, very tall and full of light. Outside the
other door, across the tall room, was the long street of the yumen city Central. Selver
had the gun in his belt. If David-son came, he could shoot him. He waited, just inside
the open door, looking out into the sunlight. Davidson came, huge, running so fast that
Selver could not keep him in the sights of the gun
37

as he doubled crazily back and forth across the wide street, very fast, always closer.
The gun was heavy. Selver fired it but no fire came out of it, and in rage and terror he
threw the gun and the dream away.
Disgusted and depressed, he spat, and sighed.
A bad dream?* Ebor Dendep inquired.
""Theyre all bad, and all the same, he said, but the deep unease and misery lessened a
little as he answered. Cool morning sunlight fell flecked ' and shafted through the fine
leaves and branches of the birch grove of Cadast. There the headwo-man sat weaving a
basket of blackstem fern, for she liked to keep her fingers busy, while Selver lay beside
her in halfdream and dream. He had been fifteen days at Cadast, and his wound was
healing well. He still slept much, but for the first time in many months he had begun to
dream waking again, regularly, not once or twice in a day and night but in the true
pulse and rhythm of dreaming which should rise and fall ten to fourteen times in the
diurnal cycle. Bad as his dreams were, all terror and shame, yet he welcomed them. He
had feared that he was cut off from his roots, that he had gone too far into the dead
land of action ever to find his way back to the springs of reality. Now, though the water
was very bitter, he drank again.
Briefly he had Davidson down again among the ashes of the burned camp, and instead
of singing over him this time he hit him in the mouth with a
38

rock. Davidson's teeth broke, and blood ran between the white splinters.
The dream was useful, a straight wishfulfil-ment, but he stopped it there, having
dreamed it many times, before he met Davidson in the ashes of Kelme Deva, and since.
There was nothing to that dream but relief. A sip of bland water. It was the bitter he
needed. He must go clear back, not to Kelme Deva but to the long dreadful street in
the alien city called Central, where he had attacked Death, and had been defeated.
Ebor Dendep hummed as she worked. Her thin hands, their silky green down silvered
with age, . worked black fern-stems in and out, fast and neat. She sang a song about
gathering ferns, a girl's song: I'm picking ferns, I wonder if he'll come back. . . . Her
faint old voice trilled like a cricket's. Sun trembled in birch leaves. Selver put his head
down on his arms.
The birch grove was more or less in the center of the town of Cadast. Eight paths led
away from it, winding narrowly off among trees. There was a whiff of woodsmoke in
the ah*; where the branches were thin at the south edge of the grove you could see
smoke rise from a house-chimney, like a bit of blue yarn unravelling among the leaves.
If you looked closely among the live-oaks and other trees you would find houseroofs
sticking up a couple of feet above ground, between a hundred and two hundred of
mem, it was very hard to count. The timber houses were three39

quarters sunk, fitted in among tree-roots like badgers' setts. The beam roofs were
mounded over with a thatch of small branches, pinestraw, reeds, earthmold. They were
insulating, waterproof, almost invisible. The forest and the community of eight hundred
people went about their business all around the birch grove where Ebor Dendep sat
making a basket of fern. A bird among the branches over her head said, **Te-wheC'
sweetly. There was more people-noise than usual, for fifty or sixty strangers, young
men and women mostly, had come drifting in these last few days, drawn by Selver's
presence. Some were from other cities of the North, some were those who had done
the killing at Kelme Deva with him; they had followed rumor here to follow him. Yet the
voices calling here and there and the babble of women bathing or children playing
down by the stream, were not so loud as the morning birdsong and insect-drone and
under-noise of the living forest of which the town was one element.
A girl came quickly, a young huntress the color of the pale birch leaves. Word of",The Word for World is Forest,"Le Guin, Ursula K"
1960,"mouth from the southern coast, mother, she said. * The runners at the Womens
Lodge.""
""Send her here when shes eaten. the head-woman said softly. Sh, Tolbar, cant you
see hes asleep?
The girl stooped to pick a large leaf of wild tobacco, and laid it lightly over Selver's
eyes, on which a shaft of the steepening, bright sunlight had fallen. He lay with his
hands half open and his
scarred, damaged face turned upward, vulnerable and foolish, a Great Dreamer gone to
sleep like a child. But it was the girl's face that Ebor Dendep watched. It shone, in that
uneasy shade, with pity and terror, with adoration.
Tolbar darted away. Presently two of the Old Women came with the messenger,
moving silent in single file along the sun-flecked path. Ebor Dendep raised her hand,
enjoining silence. The ¢ messenger promptly lay down flat, and rested; her brown-

dappled green fur was dusty and sweaty, she had run far and fast. The Old Women sat
down in patches of sun, and became still. Like two old grey-green stones they sat
there, with bright living eyes.
Selver, struggling with a sleep-dream beyond his control, cried out as if in great fear,
and woke.
He went to drink from the stream; when he came back he was followed by six or seven
of those who always followed him. The head woman put down her half-finished work
and said, Now be welcome, runner, and speak.
Hie runner stood up, bowed her head to Ebor Dendep, and spoke her message: I come",The Word for World is Forest,"Le Guin, Ursula K"
1961,"from Trethat. My words come from Sorbron Deva, before that from sailors of the Strait,",The Word for World is Forest,"Le Guin, Ursula K"
1962,before mat from Broter in Sornol. They are for the hearing of all Cadast but they are to,The Word for World is Forest,"Le Guin, Ursula K"
1963,be spoken to the man called Selver who was born of the Ash in Eshreth. Here are the,The Word for World is Forest,"Le Guin, Ursula K"
1964,"words: There are new giants in the great city of the giants in Sornol, and many of these",The Word for World is Forest,"Le Guin, Ursula K"
1965,new ones are females. The yellow ship of,The Word for World is Forest,"Le Guin, Ursula K"
1966,40,The Word for World is Forest,"Le Guin, Ursula K"
1967,fire goes up and down at the place that was called Peha. It is known in Sornol that,The Word for World is Forest,"Le Guin, Ursula K"
1968,Selver of Eshreth burned the city of the giants at Kelme Deva. The Great Dreamers of,The Word for World is Forest,"Le Guin, Ursula K"
1969,the Exiles in Broter have dreamed giants more numerous than the trees of the Forty,The Word for World is Forest,"Le Guin, Ursula K"
1970,"Lands. These are all the words of the message I bear.
After the singsong recitation they were all silent. The bird, a little farther off, said,
Whet-whet? experimentally.

'

This is a very bad world-time, said one of the Old Women, nibbing a rheumatic knee.
A grey bird flew from a huge oak that marked the north edge of town, and went up in
circles, riding the morning updraft on lazy wings. There was always a roosting-tree of
these grey kites near a town; they were the garbage service.
A small, fat boy ran through the birch grove, pursued by a slightly larger sister, bom
shrieking in tiny voices like bats. The boy fell down and cried, the girl stood him up and
scrubbed his tears off with a large leaf. They scuttled off into the forest hand in hand.
There was one called Lyubov, Selver said to the head woman. I have spoken of him",The Word for World is Forest,"Le Guin, Ursula K"
1971,"to Com Mena, but not to you. When that one was killing me, it was Lyubov who saved",The Word for World is Forest,"Le Guin, Ursula K"
1972,"me. It was Lyubov who healed me, and set me free. He wanted to know about us; so I",The Word for World is Forest,"Le Guin, Ursula K"
1973,"would tell him what he asked, and he too would tell me what I asked. Once 1 asked",The Word for World is Forest,"Le Guin, Ursula K"
1974,"how his race could survive, having so few",The Word for World is Forest,"Le Guin, Ursula K"
1975,42,The Word for World is Forest,"Le Guin, Ursula K"
1976,"women. He said mat in the place where they come from, half the race is women; but",The Word for World is Forest,"Le Guin, Ursula K"
1977,the men would not bring women to the Forty Lands until they had made a place ready,The Word for World is Forest,"Le Guin, Ursula K"
1978,"for them.
* * Until the men made a fit place for the women ? Well! they may have quite a wait,",The Word for World is Forest,"Le Guin, Ursula K"
1979,"said Ebor Dendep. They're like the people in the Elm Dream who come at you rumpfirst, with their heads put on front to back. They make the forest into a dry beachîher",The Word for World is Forest,"Le Guin, Ursula K"
1980,"language had no word for desertîand call that making things ready for the women?
They should have sent the women first. Maybe with them the women do the Great
Dreaming, who knows? They are backwards, Selver. They are insane.",The Word for World is Forest,"Le Guin, Ursula K"
1981,A people can't be insane.,The Word for World is Forest,"Le Guin, Ursula K"
1982," But they only dream in sleep, you said; if they want to dream waking they take",The Word for World is Forest,"Le Guin, Ursula K"
1983,"poisons so that the dreams go out of control, you said! How can people be any",The Word for World is Forest,"Le Guin, Ursula K"
1984,"madder? They dont know the dream-time from the world-time, any more than a baby,
does. Maybe when they kill a tree they think it will come alive again!""
Selver shook his head. He still spoke to the headwoman as if he and she were alone in
the birch grove, in a quiet hesitant voice, almost drowsily. ""No, they understand death
very well. . . . Certainly they dont see as we do, but they know more and understand",The Word for World is Forest,"Le Guin, Ursula K"
1985,more about certain things than we do. Lyubov mostly understood what I told him. Much,The Word for World is Forest,"Le Guin, Ursula K"
1986,"of what he told me, I",The Word for World is Forest,"Le Guin, Ursula K"
1987,43,The Word for World is Forest,"Le Guin, Ursula K"
1988,couldnt understand. It wasnt the language that kept me from understanding; I know,The Word for World is Forest,"Le Guin, Ursula K"
1989,"his tongue, and he learned ours; we made a writing of the two languages together. Yet",The Word for World is Forest,"Le Guin, Ursula K"
1990,there were things he said I could never understand. He said the yumens are from,The Word for World is Forest,"Le Guin, Ursula K"
1991,"outside the forest. Thats quite clear. He said they want the forest: the trees for wood,
the land to plant grass on."" Selvers voice, though still soft, had taken on resonance;",The Word for World is Forest,"Le Guin, Ursula K"
1992,"the people among the silver trees listened. That too is clear, to those of us who've
seen them cutting down the world. He said the yumens are men like us, that we're
indeed related, as close kin maybe as the Red Deer to the Greybuck. He said that they
come from another place which is not the forest; the trees there are all cut down; it has
a sun, not our sun, which is a star. All this, as you see, wasn't clear to me. I say his
words but don't know what they mean. It does not matter much. It is clear that they
want our forest for themselves. They are twice our stature, they have weapons that
out-shoot ours by far, and firethrowers, and flying ships. Now they have brought more
women, and will have children. There are maybe two thousand, maybe three thousand
of them here now, mostly in Soraol. But if we wait a lifetime or two they will breed;
their numbers will double and redouble. They kill men and women; they do not spare
those who ask life. They cannot sing in contest. They have left their roots behind them,
perhaps, in this other forest from which they
44

came, this forest with no trees. So they take poison to let loose die dreams in them, but
it only makes them drunk or sick. No one can say certainly whether they're men or not
men, whether they're sane or insane, but that does not matter. They must be made to
leave the forest, because they are dangerous. If they will not go they must be burned
out of the Lands, as nests of stinging-ants must be burned out of the groves of cities. If
we wait, it is we that will be smoked out and burned. They can step on us as we step
on stinging-ants. Once I saw a woman, it was when they burned my city Eshreth, she
lay down in the path before a yumen to ask him for life, and he stepped on her back
and broke the spine, and then kicked her aside as if she was a dead snake. I saw that.
If die yumens are men they are men unfit or untaught to dream and to act as men.
Therefore they go about in torment killing and destroying, driven by the gods within,
whom they will not set free but try to uproot and deny. If they are men they are evil
men, having denied their own gods, afraid to see their own faces in the dark. Headwoman of Cadast, hear me. Selver stood up, tall and abrupt among the seated women.",The Word for World is Forest,"Le Guin, Ursula K"
1993,"It's time, I think, that I go back to my own land, to Soraol, to those that are in exile

2001,"Lodge. See wholl be going with Selver, see about food for mem to carry. Let me be a
while. Im as full of forebodings as a stupid old man, I must dream. ...
Coro Mena went with Selver that night as far as the place where they first met, under
the copper willows by the stream. Many people were following Selver south, some sixty
in all, as great a troop as most people had ever seen on the move at once. They would
cause great stir and thus gather many more to mem, on their way to the sea-crossing
to Sornol. Selver had claimed his Dreamer's privilege of solitude for this one night. He
was setting off alone. His followers would catch him up in the morning; and thenceforth,
implicated in crowd and act, he would have little time for the slow and deep running of
the great dreams.

Here we met, the old man said, stopping among the bowing branches, the veils of
drooping leaves, and here part. This will be called-Sel-vers Grove, no doubt, by the
people who walk our paths hereafter.""
Selver said nothing for a while, standing still as a tree, the restless leaves about him
darkening from silver as clouds thickened over the stars. ""You are surer of me than I
am,"" he said at last, a voice in darkness.
""Yes, Im sure, Selver. . . . I was well taught in dreaming, and then Im old. I dream
very little for myself any more. Why should I? Little is new to me. And what I wanted
from my life, I have had, and more. I have had my whole life. Days like the leaves of
the forest. Im an old hollow tree, only the roots live. And so I dream only what all men",The Word for World is Forest,"Le Guin, Ursula K"
2002,dream. I have no visions and no wishes. I see what is. I see the fruit ripening on the,The Word for World is Forest,"Le Guin, Ursula K"
2003,"branch. Four years it has been ripening, that fruit of the deep-planted tree. We have all",The Word for World is Forest,"Le Guin, Ursula K"
2004,"been afraid for four years, even we who live far from the yumens cities, and have only
glimpsed them from hiding, or seen their ships fly over, or looked at the dead places
where they cut down the world, or heard mere tales of these things. We are all afraid.
Children wake from sleep crying of giants; women will not go far on their tradingjourneys;
46

men in the Lodges cannot sing. The fruit of fear is ripening. And I see you gather it.
You are the harvester. All that we fear to know, you have seen, you have known: exile,
shame, pain, the roof and walls of the world fallen, the mother dead in misery, the
children untaught, un-cherished. . . . This is a new time for the world: a bad time. And
you have suffered it all. You have gone farthest. And at the farthest, at the end of the
black path, there grows the Tree; there the fruit ripens; now you reach up, Selver, now
you gather it. And the world changes wholly, when a man holds in his band the fruit of
that tree, whose roots are deeper than the forest. Men will know it. They will know you,
as we did. It doesnt take an old man or a great Dreamer to recognize a god! Where",The Word for World is Forest,"Le Guin, Ursula K"

2006,"perhaps others do not, this is why I have loved you: I dreamed of you before we met",The Word for World is Forest,"Le Guin, Ursula K"

The night darkened as Selver went, until even his night-seeing eyes saw nothing but
masses and planes of black. It began to rain. He had gone only a few miles from Cadast
when he must either light a torch, or halt. He chose to halt, and groping found a place
among the roots of a great chestnut tree. There he sat, his back against the broad,
twisting bole that seemed to hold a little sun-warmth in it still. The fine rain, falling
unseen in darkness, pattered on the leaves overhead, on his arms and neck and head
protected by their thick silk-fine hair, on the earth and ferns and undergrowth nearby,
on all the leaves of the forest, near and far. Selver sat as quiet as the grey owl on a
branch above him, unsleeping, his eyes wide open in the rainy dark.

Chapter Three

CAPTAIN Raj Lyubov had a headache. It began softly in the muscles of his right
shoulder, and mounted crescendo to a smashing drumbeat over his right ear. The
speech centers are in the left cerebral cortex, he thought, but he couldn't have said it;
couldn't speak, or read, or sleep, or think. Cortex,' vortex. Migraine headache,
margarine breadache, ow, ow, ow. Of course he had been cured of migraine once at
college and again during his obligatory Army Prophylactic Psychotherapy Sessions, but
he had brought along some ergotamine pills when he left Earth, just in ease. He had
taken two, and a superhyperduper-analgesic, and a tranquilizer, and a digestive pill to
counteract the caffeine which counteracted the ergotamine, but the awl still bored out
from within, just over his right ear, to the beat of the big bass drum. Awl, drill, ill, pill,
oh God. Lord deliver us. Liver sausage. What would the Ath-sheans do for a migraine?
They wouldn't have one, they would have daydreamed the tensions
51

away a week before they got them. Try it, try daydreaming. Begin as Selver taught you.
Although knowing nothing of electricity be could not really grasp the principle of the
EEC, as soon as he heard about alpha waves and when they appear he had said, Oh",The Word for World is Forest,"Le Guin, Ursula K"
2010,"yes, you mean this, and there appeared the unmistakable alpha-squiggles on the
graph recording what went on inside his small green head; and he had taught Lyubov
how to turn on and off the alpha-rhythms in one half-hour lesson. There really was
nothing to it. But not now, the world is too much with us, ow, ow, ow above the right
ear I always hear Time's winged chariot hurrying near, for the Athsheans had burned
Smith Camp day before yesterday and killed two hundred men. Two hundred and seven
to be precise. Every man ah've except the Captain. No wonder pills couldn't get at the
center of his migraine, for it was on an island two hundred miles away two days ago.
Over the hills and far away. Ashes, ashes, all fall down. And amongst the ashes, all his
knowledge of the High Intelligence Life Forms of World 41. Dust, rubbish, a mess of
false data and fake hypotheses. Nearly five E-years here, and he had believed the Athshearis to be incapable of killing men, his kind or their kind. He had written long papers
to explain how and why they couldn't kill men.. All wrong. Dead wrong.
What had he failed to see?
It was nearly time to be going over to the meeting at HQ. Cautiously Lyubov stood up,
52

moving all in one piece so that the right side of his head would not fall off; he
approached his desk with the gait of a man underwater, poured out a shot of General
Issue vodka, and drank it. It turned him inside out: it extraverted him: it normalized
him. He felt better. He went out, and unable to stand the jouncing of bis motorbike,
started to walk down the long, dusty main street of Centralville to HQ. Passing the Luau
he thought with greed of another vodka; but Captain David-son was just going in the
door, and Lyubov went on.
The people from the Shackleton were already in the conference room. Commander
Yung, whom he had met before, had brought some new faces down from orbit this
time. They were not in Navy .uniform; after a moment Lyubov recognized them, with a
slight shock, as non-Terran humans. He sought an introduction at once. One, Mr. Or,
was a Hairy Cetian, dark grey, stocky, and dour; and the other, Mr. Lepennon, was tall,
white, and comely: a Hainishman. They greeted .Lyubov with interest, and Lepennon
said, Ive just been reading your report on the conscious control of paradoxical sleep
among the Athsheans, Dr. Lyubov,"" which was pleasant, and it was pleasant also to be
called by his own, earned title of doctor. Their conversation indicated that they had
spent some years on Earth, and that they might be hilfers, or something like it; but the
Commander, introducing them, had not mentioned (heir status or position.
53

The room was filling up. Gosse, the colony ecologist, came in; so did all the high brass;
so did Captain Susun, head of Planet Development-logging operationsîwhose
captaincy like Lyu-bovs was an invention necessary to the peace of the military mind.",The Word for World is Forest,"Le Guin, Ursula K"
2011,"Captain Davidsoo came in alone, straight-backed and handsome, his lean, rugged face",The Word for World is Forest,"Le Guin, Ursula K"
2012,calm and rather stem. Guards stood at all the doors. The Army necks were all stiff as,The Word for World is Forest,"Le Guin, Ursula K"
2013,"crowbars. Hie conference was plainly an Investigation. Whose fault? My fault, Lyubov",The Word for World is Forest,"Le Guin, Ursula K"
2014,thought despairingly; but out of his despair he looked across the table at Captain Don,The Word for World is Forest,"Le Guin, Ursula K"
2015,Davidson with detestation and contempt.,The Word for World is Forest,"Le Guin, Ursula K"
2016,"Commander Yung had a very quiet voice. As you know, gentlemen, my ship stopped",The Word for World is Forest,"Le Guin, Ursula K"
2017,"here at World 41 to drop you off a new load of colonists, and nothing more;",The Word for World is Forest,"Le Guin, Ursula K"
2018,"Shackletons mission is,to World 88, Prestno, one of the Hainish Group. However, this
attack on your outpost camp, since it chanced to occur during our week here, cant be",The Word for World is Forest,"Le Guin, Ursula K"
2019,simply ignored; particularly in the light of certain developments which you would have,The Word for World is Forest,"Le Guin, Ursula K"
2020,"been informed of a little later, in the normal course of events. The fact is that the status",The Word for World is Forest,"Le Guin, Ursula K"
2021,"of World 41 as an Earth Colony is now subject to revision, and the massacre at your",The Word for World is Forest,"Le Guin, Ursula K"
2022,"camp may precipitate the Administrations decisions on it. Certainly the decisions we
can make must be made quickly, for I cant keep my ship here long. Now first, we wish",The Word for World is Forest,"Le Guin, Ursula K"
2023,to make sure that the relevant facts are all in the possession of those present. Captain,The Word for World is Forest,"Le Guin, Ursula K"
2024,"Davidsons
report on the events at Smith Camp was taped and heard by all of us on ship; by all of
you here also? Good. Now if there are questions any of you wish to ask Captain
Davidson, go ahead. I have one myself. You returned to the site of the camp the
following day, Captain Davidson, in a large hopper with eight soldiers; had you the
permission of a senior officer here at Central for that flight?""
Davidson stood up. ""I did, sir.**
 * Were you authorized to land and to set fires in the forest near the campside?

No, sir.
You did, however, set fires?
I did, sir. I was trying to smoke out the creechies that killed my men.
Very well. Mr. Lepennon?
The tall Hainishman cleared his throat. Captain Davidson, he said, do you think that",The Word for World is Forest,"Le Guin, Ursula K"
2025,"the people under your command at Smith Camp were mostly content?
Yes, I do.
Davidson's manner was firm and forthright; he seemed indifferent to the fact that he
was in trouble. Of course these Navy officers and foreigners had no authority, over him;
it was to his own Colonel that he must answer for losing two hundred men and making
unauthorized reprisals. But his Colonel was right there, listening.
They were well fed, well housed, not overworked, then, as well as can be managed in",The Word for World is Forest,"Le Guin, Ursula K"
2026,"a frontier camp?
Yes.
54

Was the discipline maintained very harsh?
No, it was not.**",The Word for World is Forest,"Le Guin, Ursula K"
2027,"What, then, do you think motivated the revolt?",The Word for World is Forest,"Le Guin, Ursula K"
2028,I don't understand.,The Word for World is Forest,"Le Guin, Ursula K"
2029,"If none of them were discontented, why did some of mem massacre the rest and
destroy the camp?",The Word for World is Forest,"Le Guin, Ursula K"
2030,There was a worried silence.,The Word for World is Forest,"Le Guin, Ursula K"
2031,"May I put in a word, Lyubov said. It was the native hilfs, the Amsheans employed in
the camp, who joined with an attack by the forest people against the Terran humans.
In his report Captain Davidson referred to the Athsheans as creechies.* 
Lepennon looked embarrassed and anxious.
Thank you, Dr. Lyubov. I misunderstood entirely. Actually I took the word creechie* to
stand for a Terran caste that did rather menial work in the logging camps. Believing, as
we all did, mat the Amsheans were intraspecies non-aggressive, I never thought they
might be the group meant. In fact I didnt realize that they cooperated with you in your",The Word for World is Forest,"Le Guin, Ursula K"
2032,"camps.îHowever, I am more at a loss than ever to understandwhat provoked the
attack and mutiny.""
""I dont know, sir.
When he said the people under his command were content, did the Captain include",The Word for World is Forest,"Le Guin, Ursula K"
2033,"native people?** said the Cetian, Or, in a dry mumble. The Hainishman picked it up at",The Word for World is Forest,"Le Guin, Ursula K"
2034,"once, and asked Davidson, in his concerned, courteous voice.",The Word for World is Forest,"Le Guin, Ursula K"
2035,56,The Word for World is Forest,"Le Guin, Ursula K"
2036,"Were the Athsheans living at the camp content, do you think?",The Word for World is Forest,"Le Guin, Ursula K"
2037,So far as I know.,The Word for World is Forest,"Le Guin, Ursula K"
2038,"There was nothing unusual in their position there, or the work they had to do?",The Word for World is Forest,"Le Guin, Ursula K"
2039,"Lyubov felt the heightening of tension, one turn of the screw, in Colonel Dongh and his",The Word for World is Forest,"Le Guin, Ursula K"
2040,"staff, and also in the starship commander. Davidson remained calm and easy. Nothing
unusual.",The Word for World is Forest,"Le Guin, Ursula K"
2041,Lyubov knew now that only his scientific studies had been sent up to the Shackleton;,The Word for World is Forest,"Le Guin, Ursula K"
2042,"his protests, even his annual assessments of Native Adjustment to Colonial Presence*
required by the Administration, had been kept in some desk drawer deep in HQ. These
two N.-T.H.s knew nothing about the exploitation of the Athsheans. Commander Yung",The Word for World is Forest,"Le Guin, Ursula K"
2043,"did, of course; he had been down before today and had probably seen the creechiepens. In any case a Navy commander on Colony runs wouldnt have much to learn
about Terran-hilf relations. Whether or not he approved of how the Colonial
Administration ran its business, not much would come as a shock to him. But a Cetian
and a Hainishman, how much would they know about Terran colonies, unless chance
brought them to one on the way to somewhere else? Lepennon and Or had not
intended to come on-planet here at all. Or possibly they had not been intended to come
on-planet, but, hearing of trouble, had insisted. Why had the commander brought them
down: his will, or theirs? Whoever they were they had about them a hint of authority,
57

a whiff of the dry, intoxicating odor of power. Lyubovs headache had gone, he felt alert",The Word for World is Forest,"Le Guin, Ursula K"
2044,"and excited, his face was rather hot. ""Captain David-son,"" he said, ""I have a couple of
questions, concerning your confrontation with the four natives, day before yesterday.
You* re certain that one of them was San, or Selver Thele?""
""I believe so.""
""Youre aware that he has a personal grudge against you.
I dont know.""
""You dont? Since his wife died in your quarters immediately subsequent to sexual",The Word for World is Forest,"Le Guin, Ursula K"
2045,"intercourse with you, he holds you responsible for her death; you didnt know that? He
attacked you once before, here in Centralville; you had forgotten that? Well, the point
is, mat Selvers personal hatred for Captain Davidson may serve as a partial explanation",The Word for World is Forest,"Le Guin, Ursula K"
2046,"or motivation for mis unprecedented assault. The Athsheans arent incapable of
personal violence, thats never been asserted in any of my studies of them. Adolescents",The Word for World is Forest,"Le Guin, Ursula K"
2047,"who havent mastered controlled dreaming or competitive singing do a lot of wrestling
and fist-fighting, not all of it good-tempered. But Selver is an adult and an adept; and
his first, personal attack on Captain Davidson, which I happened to witness pan of, was
pretty certainly an attempt to kill. As was the Captains retaliation, incidentally. At the",The Word for World is Forest,"Le Guin, Ursula K"
2048,"time, I thought that attack an isolated psychotic incident, resulting from grief and",The Word for World is Forest,"Le Guin, Ursula K"
2049,"stress, not likely to be repeated. I was wrong.îCaptain, when the four",The Word for World is Forest,"Le Guin, Ursula K"
2050,58,The Word for World is Forest,"Le Guin, Ursula K"
2051,"Athsheans jumped you from ambush, as you describe in your report, did you end up",The Word for World is Forest,"Le Guin, Ursula K"
2052,"prone on the ground?
Yes.
In what position?
Davidson's calm face tensed and stiffened, and Lyubov felt a pang of compunction. He
wanted to corner Davidson in his lies, to force him into speaking truth once, but not to
humiliate him before others. Accusations of rape and murder supported Davidson's
image of himself as the totally virile man, but now that image was endangered: Lyubov
had called up a picture of him, the soldier, the fighter, the cool tough man, being
knocked down by enemies the size of six-year-olds. . . . What did it cost Davidson,
then, to recall that moment when he had lain looking up at the little green men, for
once, not down at them?
I was on my back.
Was your head thrown back, or turned aside?
I dont know.""
""Im trying to establish a fact here, Captain, one that might help explain why Selver",The Word for World is Forest,"Le Guin, Ursula K"
2053,"didnt kill you, although he had a grudge against you and had helped kill two hundred
men a few hours earlier. I wondered if you might by chance have been in one of the
positions which, when assumed by an Athshean, prevent his opponent from further
physical aggression,""
""I dont know.
59

Lyubov glanced round the conference table; all the faces showed curiosity and some
tension. 1 'These aggression-halting gestures and positions may have some innate
basis, may rise from a surviving trigger-response, but they are socially developed and
expanded, and of course learned. The strongest and completes! of them is a prone
position, on the back, eyes shut, head turned1 so the throat is fully exposed. I think an
Athshean of the local cultures might find it impossible to hurt an enemy who took that
position. He would have to do something else to release his anger or aggressive drive.
When they had all got you down, Captain, did Selver by any chance sing?''
Did he what?
Sing.
I dont know.""
Block. No go. Lyubov was about to shrug and give it up when the Cetian said, ""Why,
Mr. Lyubov?' The most winning characteristic of the rather harsh Cetian temperament
was curiosity, inopportune and inexhausitible curiosity; Cetians died eagerly, curious as
to what came next.
""You see,"" Lyubov said, ""the Athsheans use a kind of ritualised singing to replace
physical combat. Again its a universal social phenomenon that might have a",The Word for World is Forest,"Le Guin, Ursula K"
2054,"physiological foundation, though its very hard to establish anything as innate* in",The Word for World is Forest,"Le Guin, Ursula K"

CHAPTER 2
A chair, a table, a lamp. Above, on the white ceiling, a relief ornament in the shape of a wreath, and in the center of it a blank space, plastered
over, like the place in a face where the eye has been taken out. There must have been a chandelier, once. Theyve removed anything you could tie a",The Handmaids Tale,"Atwood, Margaret"

2066,"A window, two white curtains. Under the window, a window seat with a little cushion. When the window is partly open î it only opens partly î",The Handmaids Tale,"Atwood, Margaret"
2067,"the air can come in and make the curtains move. I can sit in the chair, or on the window seat, hands folded, and watch this. Sunlight comes in",The Handmaids Tale,"Atwood, Margaret"
2068,"through the window too, and falls on the floor, which is made of wood, in narrow strips, highly polished. I can smell the polish. Theres a rug on the
floor, oval, of braided rags. This is the kind of touch they like: folk art, archaic, made by women, in their spare time, from things that have no further
use. A return to traditional values. Waste not want not. I am not being wasted. Why do I want?
On the wall above the chair, a picture, framed but with no glass: a print of flowers, blue irises, watercolor. Flowers are still allowed, Does each
of us have the same print, the same chair, the same white curtains, I wonder? Government issue?
Think of it as being in the army, said Aunt Lydia.
A bed. Single, mattress medium-hard, covered with a flocked white spread. Nothing takes place in the bed but sleep; or no sleep. I try not to
think too much. Like other things now, thought must be rationed. Theres a lot that doesnt bear thinking about. Thinking can hurt your chances, and I
intend to last. I know why there is no glass, in front of the watercolor picture of blue irises, and why the window opens only partly and why the glass in
it is shatterproof. It isnt running away theyre afraid of. We wouldnt get far. Its those other escapes, the ones you can open in yourself, given a
cutting edge.
So. Apart from these details, this could be a college guest room, for the less distinguished visitors; or a room in a rooming house, of former
times, for ladies in reduced circumstances. That is what we are now. The circumstances have been reduced; for those of us who still have
circumstances.
But a chair, sunlight, flowers: these are not to be dismissed. I am alive, I live, I breathe, I put my hand out, unfolded, into the sunlight. Where I am
is not a prison but a privilege, as Aunt Lydia said, who was in love with either/or.

The bell that measures time is ringing. Time here is measured by bells, as once in nunneries. As in a nunnery too, there are few mirrors.
I get up out of the chair, advance my feet into the sunlight, in their red shoes, flat-heeled to save the spine and not for dancing. The red gloves
are lying on the bed. I pick them up, pull them onto my hands, finger by finger. Everything except the wings around my face is red: the color of blood,
which defines us. The skirt is ankle-length, full, gathered to a flat yoke that extends over the breasts, the sleeves are full. The white wings too are
prescribed issue; they are to keep us from seeing, but also from being seen. I never looked good in red, its not my color. I pick up the shopping",The Handmaids Tale,"Atwood, Margaret"

The carpet bends and goes down the front staircase and I go with it, one hand on the banister, once a tree, turned in another century, rubbed to
a warm gloss. Late Victorian, the house is, a family house, built for a large rich family. Theres a grandfather clock in the hallway, which doles out",The Handmaids Tale,"Atwood, Margaret"

and concealing, but with a bib apron over it and without the white wings and the veil. She puts on the veil to go outside, but nobody much cares who
sees the face of a Martha. Her sleeves are rolled to the elbow, showing her brown arms. Shes making bread, throwing the loaves for the final brief",The Handmaids Tale,"Atwood, Margaret"

a disease or any form of bad luck.

and we would sit at Ritas kitchen table, which is not Ritas any more than my table is mine, and we would talk, about aches and pains, illnesses, our
feet, our backs, all the different kinds of mischief that our bodies, like unruly children, can get into. We would nod our heads as punctuation to each

2101,"But even if I were to ask, even if I were to violate decorum to that extent, Rita would not allow it. She would be too afraid. The Marthas are not",The Handmaids Tale,"Atwood, Margaret"
2102,supposed to fraternize with us.,The Handmaids Tale,"Atwood, Margaret"
2103,Fraternize means to behave like a brother. Luke told me that. He said there was no corresponding word that meant to behave like a sister.,The Handmaids Tale,"Atwood, Margaret"
2104,"Sororize, it would have to be, he said. From the Latin. He liked knowing about such details. The derivations of words, curious usages. I used to",The Handmaids Tale,"Atwood, Margaret"
2105,tease him about being pedantic.,The Handmaids Tale,"Atwood, Margaret"
2106,"I take the tokens from Ritas outstretched hand. They have pictures on them, of the things they can be exchanged for twelve eggs, a piece of
cheese, a brown thing thats supposed to be a steak. I place them in the zippered pocket in my sleeve, where I keep my pass.",The Handmaids Tale,"Atwood, Margaret"
2107,"Tell them fresh, for the eggs, she said. Not like the last time. And a chicken, tell them, not a hen. Tell them who it's for and then they won't
mess around.",The Handmaids Tale,"Atwood, Margaret"
2108,"All right, I say. I dont smile. Why tempt her to friendship?

CHAPTER 3
I go out by the back door, into the garden, which is large and tidy: a lawn in the middle, a willow, weeping catkins; around the edges, the flower
borders, in which the daffodils are now fading and the tulips are opening their cups, spilling out color. The tulips are red, a darker crimson towards
the stem, as if they have been cut and are beginning to heal there.
This garden is the domain of the Commanders Wife. Looking out through my shatterproof window Ive often seen her in it, her knees on a
cushion, a light blue veil thrown over her wide gardening hat, a basket at her side with shears in it and pieces of string for tying the flowers into
place. A Guardian detailed to the Commander does the heavy digging; the Commanders Wife directs, pointing with her stick. Many of the Wives",The Handmaids Tale,"Atwood, Margaret"
2109,"have such gardens, its something for them to order and maintain and care for.
I once had a garden. I can remember the smell of the turned earth, the plump shapes of bulbs held in the hands, fullness, the dry rustle of seeds
through the fingers. Time could pass more swiftly that way. Sometimes the Commanders Wife has a chair brought out, and just sits in it, in her",The Handmaids Tale,"Atwood, Margaret"
2110,garden. From a distance it looks like peace.,The Handmaids Tale,"Atwood, Margaret"
2111,"She isnt here now, and I start to wonder where she is: I dont like to come upon the Commanders Wife unexpectedly. Perhaps shes sewing, in",The Handmaids Tale,"Atwood, Margaret"
2112,"the sitting room, with her left foot on the footstool, because of her arthritis. Or knitting scarves, for the Angels at the front lines. I can hardly believe",The Handmaids Tale,"Atwood, Margaret"
2113,"the Angels have a need for such scarves; anyway, the ones made by the Commanders Wife are too elaborate. She doesnt bother with the crossand-star pattern used by many of the other Wives, its not a challenge. Fir trees march across the ends of her scarves, or eagles, or stiff humanoid
figures, boy and girl, boy and girl. They arent scarves for grown men but for children.",The Handmaids Tale,"Atwood, Margaret"
2114,"Sometimes I think these scarves arent sent to the Angels at all, but unraveled and turned back into balls of yarn, to be knitted again in their
turn. Maybe its just something to keep the Wives busy, to give them a sense of purpose. But I envy the Commanders Wife her knitting. Its good to",The Handmaids Tale,"Atwood, Margaret"
2115,have small goals that can be easily attained.,The Handmaids Tale,"Atwood, Margaret"
2116,What does she envy me?,The Handmaids Tale,"Atwood, Margaret"
2117,"She doesnt speak to me, unless she cant avoid it. I am a reproach to her; and a necessity.",The Handmaids Tale,"Atwood, Margaret"
2118,"We stood face to face for the first time five weeks ago, when I arrived at this posting. The Guardian from the previous posting brought me to",The Handmaids Tale,"Atwood, Margaret"
2119,"the front door. On first days we are permitted front doors, but after that were supposed to use the back. Things havent settled down, its too soon,
everyone is unsure about our exact status. After a while it will be either all front doors or all back.
Aunt Lydia said she was lobbying for the front. Yours is a position of honor, she said.
The Guardian rang the doorbell for me, but before there was time for someone to hear and walk quickly to answer, the door opened inward.
She must have been waiting behind it, I was expecting a Martha, but it was her instead, in her long powder-blue robe, unmistakable.
So, youre the new one, she said. She didnt step aside to let me in, she just stood there in the doorway, blocking the entrance. She wanted me
to feel that I could not come into the house unless she said so. There is push and shove, these days, over such toeholds.
Yes, I said.

Leave it on the porch. She said this to the Guardian, who was carrying my bag. The bag was red vinyl and not large. There was another bag,
with the winter cloak and heavier dresses, but that would be coming later.
The Guardian set down the bag and saluted her. Then I could hear his footsteps behind me, going back down the walk, and the click of the front
gate, and I felt as if a protective arm were being withdrawn. The threshold of a new house is a lonely place.
She waited until the car started up and pulled away. I wasnt looking at her face, but at the part of her I could see with my head lowered: her blue",The Handmaids Tale,"Atwood, Margaret"
2120,"waist, thickened, her left hand on the ivory head of her cane, the large diamonds on the ring finger, which must once have been fine and was still",The Handmaids Tale,"Atwood, Margaret"
2121,"finely kept, the fingernail at the end of the knuckly finger filed to a gentle curving point. It was like an ironic smile, on that finger; like something",The Handmaids Tale,"Atwood, Margaret"
2122,mocking her.,The Handmaids Tale,"Atwood, Margaret"
2123,"You might as well come in, she said. She turned her back on me and limped down the hall. Shut the door behind you.",The Handmaids Tale,"Atwood, Margaret"
2124,"I lifted my red bag inside, as shed no doubt intended, then closed the door. I didnt say anything to her. Aunt Lydia said it was best not to speak",The Handmaids Tale,"Atwood, Margaret"
2125,"unless they asked you a direct question. Try to think of it from their point of view, she said, her hands clasped and wrung together, her nervous",The Handmaids Tale,"Atwood, Margaret"
2126,"pleading smile. It isnt easy for them.
In here, said the Commanders Wife. When I went into the sitting room she was already in her chair, her left foot on the footstool, with its petit",The Handmaids Tale,"Atwood, Margaret"
2127,"point cushion, roses in a basket. Her knitting was on the floor beside the chair, the needles stuck through it.",The Handmaids Tale,"Atwood, Margaret"
2128,"I stood in front of her, hands folded. So, she said. She had a cigarette, and she put it between her lips and gripped it there while she lit it. Her",The Handmaids Tale,"Atwood, Margaret"
2129,"lips were thin, held that way, with the small vertical lines around them you used to see in advertisements for lip cosmetics. The lighter was ivorycolored. The cigarettes must have come from the black market, I thought, and this gave me hope. Even now that there is no real money anymore,",The Handmaids Tale,"Atwood, Margaret"
2130,"theres still a black market. Theres always a black market, theres always something that can be exchanged. She then was a woman who might
bend the rules. But what did I have, to trade?
I looked at the cigarette with longing. For me, like liquor and coffee, they are forbidden.
So old whats-his-face didnt work out, she said.
No, maam, I said.",The Handmaids Tale,"Atwood, Margaret"
2131,"She gave what might have been a laugh, then coughed. Tough luck on him, she said. This is your second, isnt it?
Third, maam, I said.",The Handmaids Tale,"Atwood, Margaret"
2132,"Not so good for you either, she said. There was another coughing laugh. You can sit down. I dont make a practice of it, but just this time.
I did sit, on the edge of one of the stiff-backed chairs. I didnt want to stare around the room, I didnt want to appear inattentive to her; so the
marble mantelpiece to my right and the mirror over it and the bunches of flowers were just shadows, then, at the edges of my eyes. Later I would
have more than enough time to take them in.
Now her face was on a level with mine. I thought I recognized her; or at least there was something familiar about her. A little of her hair was
showing, from under her veil. It was still blond. I thought then that maybe she bleached it, that hair dye was something else she could get through the
black market, but I know now that it really is blond. Her eyebrows were plucked into thin arched lines, which gave her a permanent look of surprise,
or outrage, or inquisitiveness, such as you might see on a startled child, but below them her eyelids were tired-looking. Not so her eyes, which were
the flat hostile blue of a midsummer sky in bright sunlight, a blue that shuts you out. Her nose must once have been what was called cute but now
was too small for her face. Her face was not fat but it was large. Two lines led downward from the corners of her mouth; between them was her chin,
clenched like a fist.
I want to see as little of you as possible, she said. I expect you feel the same way about me.
I didnt answer, as a yes would have been insulting, a no contradictory.",The Handmaids Tale,"Atwood, Margaret"
2133,"I know you arent stupid, she went on. She inhaled, blew out the smoke. Ive read your file. As far as Im concerned, this is like a business
transaction. But if I get trouble, Ill give trouble back. You understand?",The Handmaids Tale,"Atwood, Margaret"
2134,"Yes, maam, I said.
Dont call me maam, she said irritably. Youre not a Martha.",The Handmaids Tale,"Atwood, Margaret"
2135,"I didnt ask what I was supposed to call her, because I could see that she hoped I would never have the occasion to call her anything at all. I was
disappointed. I wanted, then, to turn her into an older sister, a motherly figure, someone who would understand and protect me. The Wife in my
posting before this had spent most of her time in her bedroom; the Marthas said she drank. I wanted this one to be different. I wanted to think I
would have liked her, in another time and place, another life. But I could see already that I wouldnt have liked her, nor she me.",The Handmaids Tale,"Atwood, Margaret"
2136,"She put her cigarette out, half smoked, in a little scrolled ashtray on the lamp table beside her. She did this decisively, one jab and one grind,",The Handmaids Tale,"Atwood, Margaret"
2137,not the series of genteel taps favored by many of the Wives.,The Handmaids Tale,"Atwood, Margaret"
2138,"As for my husband, she said, hes just that. My husband. I want that to be perfectly clear. Till death do us part. Its final.",The Handmaids Tale,"Atwood, Margaret"
2139,"Yes, maam, I said again, forgetting. They used to have dolls, for little girls, that would talk if you pulled a string at the back; I thought I was
sounding like that, voice of a monotone, voice of a doll. She probably longed to slap my face. They can hit us, theres Scriptural precedent. But not",The Handmaids Tale,"Atwood, Margaret"
2140,with any implement. Only with their hands.,The Handmaids Tale,"Atwood, Margaret"
2141,"Its one of the things we fought for, said the Commanders Wife, and suddenly she wasnt looking at me, she was looking down at her knuckled,
diamond-studded hands, and I knew where Id seen her before.",The Handmaids Tale,"Atwood, Margaret"
2142,"The first time was on television, when I was eight or nine. It was when my mother was sleeping in, on Sunday mornings, and I would get up early",The Handmaids Tale,"Atwood, Margaret"
2143,"and go to the television set in my mothers study and flip through the channels, looking for cartoons. Sometimes when I couldnt find any I would",The Handmaids Tale,"Atwood, Margaret"
2144,"watch the Growing Souls Gospel Hour, where they would tell Bible stories for children and sing hymns. One of the women was called Serena Joy.",The Handmaids Tale,"Atwood, Margaret"
2145,"She was the lead soprano. She was ash blond, petite, with a snub nose and huge blue eyes which shed turn upwards during hymns. She could
smile and cry at the same time, one tear or two sliding gracefully down her cheek, as if on cue, as her voice lifted through its highest notes,
tremulous, effortless. It was after that she went on to other things.
The woman sitting in front of me was Serena Joy. Or had been, once. So it was worse than I thought.

CHAPTER 4
I walk along the gravel path that divides the back lawn, neatly, like a hair parting. It has rained during the night; the grass to either side is damp,
the air humid. Here and there are worms, evidence of the fertility of the soil, caught by the sun, half dead; flexible and pink, like lips.
I open the white picket gate and continue, past the front lawn and towards the front gate. In the driveway, one of the Guardians assigned to our
household is washing the car. That must mean the Commander is in the house, in his own quarters, past the dining room and beyond, where he

seems to stay most of the time.
The car is a very expensive one, a Whirlwind; better than the Chariot, much better than the chunky, practical Behemoth. Its black, of course, the",The Handmaids Tale,"Atwood, Margaret"
2146,"color of prestige or a hearse, and long and sleek. The driver is going over it with a chamois, lovingly. This at least hasnt changed, the way men
caress good cars.
Hes wearing the uniform of the Guardians, but his cap is tilted at a jaunty angle and his sleeves are rolled to the elbow, showing his forearms,",The Handmaids Tale,"Atwood, Margaret"
2147,"tanned but with a stipple of dark hairs, He has a cigarette stuck in the corner of his mouth, which shows that he too has something he can trade on",The Handmaids Tale,"Atwood, Margaret"
2148,the black market.,The Handmaids Tale,"Atwood, Margaret"
2149,"I know this mans name: Nick. I know this because Ive heard Rita and Cora talking about him, and once I heard the Commander speaking to",The Handmaids Tale,"Atwood, Margaret"
2150,"him: Nick, I wont be needing the car.
He lives here, in the household, over the garage. Low status: he hasnt been issued a woman, not even one. He doesnt rate: some defect, lack
of connections. But he acts as if he doesnt know this, or care, Hes too casual, hes not servile enough. It may be stupidity, but I dont think so.
Smells fishy, they used to say; or, I smell a rat. Misfit as odor. Despite myself, I think of how he might smell. Not fish or decaying rat; tanned skin,
moist in the sun, filmed with smoke. I sigh, inhaling.
He looks at me, and sees me looking. He has a French face, lean, whimsical, all planes and angles, with creases around the mouth where he
smiles. He takes a final puff of the cigarette, lets it drop to the driveway, and steps on it. He begins to whistle. Then he winks.
I drop my head and turn so that the white wings hide my face, and keep walking. Hes just taken a risk, but for what? What if I were to report",The Handmaids Tale,"Atwood, Margaret"
2151,him?,The Handmaids Tale,"Atwood, Margaret"
2152,Perhaps he was merely being friendly. Perhaps he saw the look on my face and mistook it for something else. Really what I wanted was the,The Handmaids Tale,"Atwood, Margaret"
2153,cigarette.,The Handmaids Tale,"Atwood, Margaret"
2154,"Perhaps it was a test, to see what I would do. Perhaps he is an Eye.",The Handmaids Tale,"Atwood, Margaret"
2155,"I open the front gate and close it behind me, looking down but not back. The sidewalk is red brick. That is the landscape I focus on, a field of",The Handmaids Tale,"Atwood, Margaret"
2156,"oblongs, gently undulating where the earth beneath has buckled, from decade after decade of winter frost. The color of the bricks is old, yet fresh",The Handmaids Tale,"Atwood, Margaret"
2157,and clear. Sidewalks are kept much cleaner than they used to be.,The Handmaids Tale,"Atwood, Margaret"
2158,"I walk to the corner and wait. I used to be bad at waiting. They also serve who only stand and wait, said Aunt Lydia. She made us memorize it.",The Handmaids Tale,"Atwood, Margaret"
2159,"She also said, Not all of you will make it through. Some of you will fall on dry ground or thorns. Some of you are shallow-rooted. She had a mole on",The Handmaids Tale,"Atwood, Margaret"
2160,"her chin that went up and down while she talked. She said, Think of yourselves as seeds, and right then her voice was wheedling, conspiratorial,",The Handmaids Tale,"Atwood, Margaret"
2161,"like the voices of those women who used to teach ballet classes to children, and who would say, Arms up in the air now; lets pretend were trees. I",The Handmaids Tale,"Atwood, Margaret"
2162,"stand on the corner, pretending I am a tree.",The Handmaids Tale,"Atwood, Margaret"
2163,"A shape, red with white wings around the face, a shape like mine, a nondescript woman in red carrying a basket, comes along the brick",The Handmaids Tale,"Atwood, Margaret"
2164,"sidewalk towards me. She reaches me and we peer at each others faces, looking down the white tunnels of cloth that enclose us. She is the right
one.
""Blessed be the fruit,"" she says to me, the accepted greeting among us.
""May the Lord open,"" I answer, the accepted response. We turn and walk together past the large houses, towards the central part of town. We
arent allowed to go there except in twos. This is supposed to be for our protection, though the notion is absurd: we are well protected already. The",The Handmaids Tale,"Atwood, Margaret"
2165,"truth is that she is my spy, as I am hers. If either of us slips through the net because of something that happens on one of our daily walks, the other",The Handmaids Tale,"Atwood, Margaret"
2166,will be accountable.,The Handmaids Tale,"Atwood, Margaret"
2167,This woman has been my partner for two weeks. I dont know what happened to the one before. On a certain day she simply wasnt there,The Handmaids Tale,"Atwood, Margaret"
2168,"anymore, and this one was there in her place. It isnt the sort of thing you ask questions about, because the answers are not usually answers you
want to know. Anyway there wouldnt be an answer.",The Handmaids Tale,"Atwood, Margaret"
2169,"This one is a little plumper than I am. Her eyes are brown. Her name is Ofglen, and thats about all I know about her. She walks demurely, head
down, red-gloved hands clasped in front, with short little steps like a trained pigs, on its hind legs. During these walks she has never said anything",The Handmaids Tale,"Atwood, Margaret"
2170,"that was not strictly orthodox, but then, neither have I. She may be a real believer, a Handmaid in more than name. I cant take the risk.
""The war is going well, I hear,"" she says.
""Praise be,"" I reply.
""Weve been sent good weather.
Which I receive with joy.
Theyve defeated more of the rebels, since yesterday.""
""Praise be,"" I say. I dont ask her how she knows, What were they?",The Handmaids Tale,"Atwood, Margaret"
2171,Baptists. They had a stronghold in the Blue Hills. They smoked them out.,The Handmaids Tale,"Atwood, Margaret"
2172,Praise be.,The Handmaids Tale,"Atwood, Margaret"
2173,"Sometimes I wish she would just shut up and let me walk in peace. But Im ravenous for news, any kind of news; even if its false news, it must",The Handmaids Tale,"Atwood, Margaret"
2174,mean something.,The Handmaids Tale,"Atwood, Margaret"
2175,"We reach the first barrier, which is like the barriers blocking off roadworks, or dug-up sewers: a wooden crisscross painted in yellow and black",The Handmaids Tale,"Atwood, Margaret"
2176,"stripes, a red hexagon which means Stop. Near the gateway there are some lanterns, not lit because it isnt night. Above us, I know, there are
floodlights, attached to the telephone poles, for use in emergencies, and there are men with machine guns in the pillboxes on either side of the
road. I dont see the floodlights and the pillboxes, because of the wings around my face. I just know they are there.",The Handmaids Tale,"Atwood, Margaret"
2177,"Behind the barrier, waiting for us at the narrow gateway, there are two men, in the green uniforms of the Guardians of the Faith, with the crests",The Handmaids Tale,"Atwood, Margaret"
2178,"on their shoulders and berets: two swords, crossed, above a white triangle. The Guardians arent real soldiers. Theyre used for routine policing and",The Handmaids Tale,"Atwood, Margaret"
2179,"other menial functions, digging up the Commanders Wifes garden, for instance, and theyre either stupid or older or disabled or very young, apart
from the ones that are Eyes incognito.
These two are very young: one mustache is still sparse, one face is still blotchy. Their youth is touching, but I know I cant be deceived by it. The",The Handmaids Tale,"Atwood, Margaret"
2180,"young ones are often the most dangerous, the most fanatical, the jumpiest with their guns. They havent yet learned about existence through time.
You have to go slowly with them.

Last week they shot a woman, right about here. She was a Martha. She was fumbling in her robe, for her pass, and they thought she was
hunting for a bomb. They thought she was a man in disguise. There have been such incidents.
Rita and Cora knew the woman. I heard them talking about it, in the kitchen.
Doing their job, said Cora. Keeping us safe.
Nothing safer than dead, said Rita, angrily. She was minding her own business. No call to shoot her.
It was an accident, said Cora.
No such thing, said Rita. Everything is meant.
I could hear her thumping the pots around, in the sink.
Well, someonell think twice before blowing up this house, anyways, said Cora.",The Handmaids Tale,"Atwood, Margaret"
2181,"All the same, said Rita. She worked hard. That was a bad death.",The Handmaids Tale,"Atwood, Margaret"
2182,"I can think of worse, said Cora. At least it was quick.",The Handmaids Tale,"Atwood, Margaret"
2183,"You can say that, said Rita. Id choose to have some time, before, like. To set things right.

The two young Guardians salute us, raising three fingers to the rims of their berets. Such tokens are accorded to us. They are supposed to
show respect, because of the nature of our service.
We produce our passes, from the zippered pockets in our wide sleeves, and they are inspected and stamped. One man goes into the righthand pillbox, to punch our numbers into the Compuchek.
In returning my pass, the one with the peach-colored mustache bends his head to try to get a look at my face. I raise my head a little, to help
him, and he sees my eyes and I see his, and he blushes. His face is long and mournful, like a sheeps, but with the large full eyes of a dog, spaniel",The Handmaids Tale,"Atwood, Margaret"
2184,"not terrier. His skin is pale and looks unwholesomely tender, like the skin under a scab. Nevertheless, I think of placing my hand on it, this exposed",The Handmaids Tale,"Atwood, Margaret"
2185,face. He is the one who turns away.,The Handmaids Tale,"Atwood, Margaret"
2186,"Its an event, a small defiance of rule, so small as to be undetectable, but such moments are the rewards I hold out for myself, like the candy I
hoarded, as a child, at the back of a drawer. Such moments are possibilities, tiny peepholes.
What if I were to come at night, when hes on duty alone î though he would never be allowed such solitude î and permit him beyond my white",The Handmaids Tale,"Atwood, Margaret"
2187,"wings? What if I were to peel off my red shroud and show myself to him, to them, by the uncertain light of the lanterns? This is what they must think",The Handmaids Tale,"Atwood, Margaret"
2188,"about sometimes, as they stand endlessly beside this barrier, past which nobody ever comes except the Commanders of the Faithful in their long",The Handmaids Tale,"Atwood, Margaret"
2189,"black murmurous cars, or their blue Wives and white-veiled daughters on their dutiful way to Salvagings or Prayvaganzas, or their dumpy green",The Handmaids Tale,"Atwood, Margaret"
2190,"Marthas, or the occasional Birthmobile, or their red Handmaids, on foot. Or sometimes a black-painted van, with the winged Eye in white on the",The Handmaids Tale,"Atwood, Margaret"
2191,"side. The windows of the vans are dark-tinted, and the men in the front seats wear dark glasses: a double obscurity.",The Handmaids Tale,"Atwood, Margaret"
2192,"The vans are surely more silent than the other cars. When they pass, we avert our eyes. If there are sounds coming from inside, we try not to",The Handmaids Tale,"Atwood, Margaret"
2193,"hear them. Nobodys heart is perfect.
When the black vans reach a checkpoint, theyre waved through without a pause. The Guardians would not want to take the risk of looking",The Handmaids Tale,"Atwood, Margaret"
2194,"inside, searching, doubting their authority. Whatever they think.",The Handmaids Tale,"Atwood, Margaret"
2195,"If they do think; you cant tell by looking at them.
But more likely they dont think in terms of clothing discarded on the lawn. If they think of a kiss, they must then think immediately of the",The Handmaids Tale,"Atwood, Margaret"
2196,"floodlights going on, the rifle shots. They think instead of doing their duty and of promotion to the Angels, and of being allowed possibly to marry,",The Handmaids Tale,"Atwood, Margaret"
2197,"and then, if they are able to gain enough power and live to be old enough, of being allotted a Handmaid of their own.",The Handmaids Tale,"Atwood, Margaret"
2198,"The one with the mustache opens the small pedestrian gate for us and stands back, well out of the way, and we pass through. As we walk",The Handmaids Tale,"Atwood, Margaret"
2199,"away I know theyre watching, these two men who arent yet permitted to touch women. They touch with their eyes instead and I move my hips a little,",The Handmaids Tale,"Atwood, Margaret"
2200,"feeling the full red skirt sway around me. Its like thumbing your nose from behind a fence or teasing a dog with a bone held out of reach, and Im",The Handmaids Tale,"Atwood, Margaret"
2201,"ashamed of myself for doing it, because none of this is the fault of these men, theyre too young. Then I find Im not ashamed after all. I enjoy the",The Handmaids Tale,"Atwood, Margaret"
2202,"power; power of a dog bone, passive but there. I hope they get hard at the sight of us and have to rub themselves against the painted barriers,",The Handmaids Tale,"Atwood, Margaret"
2203,"surreptitiously. They will suffer, later, at night, in their regimented beds. They have no outlets now except themselves, and thats a sacrilege. There
are no more magazines, no more films, no more substitutes; only me and my shadow, walking away from the two men, who stand at attention, stiffly,
by a roadblock, watching our retreating shapes.

CHAPTER 5
Doubled, I walk the street. Though we are no longer in the Commanders compound, there are large houses here also. In front of one of them a",The Handmaids Tale,"Atwood, Margaret"
2204,"Guardian is mowing the lawn. The lawns are tidy, the facades are gracious, in good repair; theyre like the beautiful pictures they used to print in the
magazines about homes and gardens and interior decoration. There is the same absence of people, the same air of being asleep. The street is
almost like a museum, or a street in a model town constructed to show the way people used to live. As in those pictures, those museums, those
model towns, there are no children.
This is the heart of Gilead, where the war cannot intrude except on television. Where the edges are we arent sure, they vary, according to the",The Handmaids Tale,"Atwood, Margaret"
2205,"attacks and counterattacks; but this is the center, where nothing moves. The Republic of Gilead, said Aunt Lydia, knows no bounds. Gilead is within",The Handmaids Tale,"Atwood, Margaret"
2206,you.,The Handmaids Tale,"Atwood, Margaret"
2207,"Doctors lived here once, lawyers, university professors. There are no lawyers anymore, and the university is closed.",The Handmaids Tale,"Atwood, Margaret"
2208,"Luke and I used to walk together, sometimes, along these streets. We used to talk about buying a house like one of these, an old big house,",The Handmaids Tale,"Atwood, Margaret"
2209,"fixing it up. We would have a garden, swings for the Children. We would have children. Although we knew it wasnt too likely we could ever afford it,
it was something to talk about, a game for Sundays. Such freedom now seems almost weightless.

We turn the corner onto a main street, where theres more traffic. Cars go by, black most of them, some gray and brown. There are other",The Handmaids Tale,"Atwood, Margaret"
2210,"women with baskets, some in red, some in the dull green of the Marthas, some in the striped dresses, red and blue and green and cheap and",The Handmaids Tale,"Atwood, Margaret"
2211,"skimpy, that mark the women of the poorer men. Econowives, theyre called. These women are not divided into functions. They have to do
everything; if they can. Sometimes there is a woman all in black, a widow. There used to be more of them, but they seem to be diminishing. You
dont see the Commanders Wives on the sidewalks. Only in cars.
The sidewalks here are cement. Like a child, I avoid stepping on the cracks. m remembering my feet on these sidewalks, in the time before,",The Handmaids Tale,"Atwood, Margaret"
2212,"and what I used to wear on them. Sometimes it was shoes for running, with cushioned soles and breathing holes, and stars of fluorescent fabric that",The Handmaids Tale,"Atwood, Margaret"

In front of us, to the right, is the store where we order dresses. Some people call them habits, a good word for them. Habits are hard to break.
The store has a huge wooden sign outside it, in the shape of a golden lily; Lilies of the Field, its called. You can see the place, under the lily, where",The Handmaids Tale,"Atwood, Margaret"
2222,"the lettering was painted out, when they decided that even the names of shops were too much temptation for us. Now places are known by their",The Handmaids Tale,"Atwood, Margaret"

2229,"We dont go into Lilies, but across the road and along a side street. Our first stop is at a store with another wooden sign: three eggs, a bee, a
cow. Milk and Honey. Theres a line, and we wait our turn, two by two. I see they have oranges today. Ever since Central America was lost to the",The Handmaids Tale,"Atwood, Margaret"

2233,"Those whove reached the counter hand their tokens across it, to the two men in Guardian uniforms who stand on the other side. Nobody talks
much, though there is a rustling, and the womens heads move furtively from side to side: here, shopping, is where you might see someone you",The Handmaids Tale,"Atwood, Margaret"
2234,"know, someone youve known in the time before, or at the Red Center. Just to catch sight of a face like that is an encouragement. If I could see

2235,"But Ofglen, beside me, isnt looking, Maybe she doesnt know anyone anymore. Maybe they have all vanished, the women she knew. Or maybe",The Handmaids Tale,"Atwood, Margaret"
2236,"she doesnt want to be seen. She stands in silence head down.
As we wait in our double line, the door opens and two more women come in, both in the red dresses and white wings of the Handmaids. One
of them is vastly pregnant; her belly, under her loose garment, swells triumphantly. There is a shifting in the room, a murmur, an escape of breath;
despite ourselves we turn our heads, blatantly, to see better; our fingers itch to touch her. Shes a magic presence to us, an object of envy and",The Handmaids Tale,"Atwood, Margaret"
2237,"desire, we covet her. Shes a flag on a hilltop, showing us what can still be done: we too can be saved.
The women in the room are whispering, almost talking, so great is their excitement.
""Who is it?"" I hear behind me.
""Ofwayne. No. Ofwarren.""
""Show-off,"" a voice hisses, and this is true. A woman that pregnant doesnt have to go out, doesnt have to go shopping. The daily walk is no
longer prescribed, to keep her abdominal muscles in working order. She needs only the floor exercises, the breathing drill. She could stay at her
house. And its dangerous for her to be out, there must be a Guardian standing outside the door, waiting for her. Now that shes the carrier of life,
she is closer to death, and needs special security. Jealousy could get her, its happened before. All children are wanted now, but not by everyone.",The Handmaids Tale,"Atwood, Margaret"
2238,"But the walk may be a whim of hers, and they humor whims, when something has gone this far and theres been no miscarriage. Or perhaps
shes one of those, Pile it on, I can take it, a martyr. I catch a glimpse of her face, as she raises it to look around. The voice behind me was right.",The Handmaids Tale,"Atwood, Margaret"
2239,"Shes come here to display herself. Shes glowing, rosy, shes enjoying every minute of this.
""Quiet,"" says one of the Guardians behind the counter, and we hush like schoolgirls.
Ofglen and I have reached the counter. We hand over our tokens, and one Guardian enters the numbers on them into the Compubite while the
other gives us our purchases, the milk, the eggs. We put them into our baskets and go out again, past the pregnant woman and her partner, who
beside her looks spindly, shrunken; as we all do. The pregnant womans belly is like a huge fruit. Humungous, word of my childhood. Her hands",The Handmaids Tale,"Atwood, Margaret"
2240,"rest on it as if to defend it, or as if theyre gathering something from it, warmth and strength.
As I pass she looks full at me, into my eyes, and I know who she; is. She was at the Red Center with me, one of Aunt Lydias pets. I never liked",The Handmaids Tale,"Atwood, Margaret"
2241,"her. Her name, in the time before, was Janine.",The Handmaids Tale,"Atwood, Margaret"
2242,"Janine looks at me, then, and around the corners of her mouth there is the trace of a smirk. She glances down to where my own belly lies flat",The Handmaids Tale,"Atwood, Margaret"

2244,"Next we go into All Flesh, which is marked by a large wooden pork chop hanging from two chains. There isnt so much of a line here: meat is

2246,"plastic shopping bags, from the supermarket; I hated to waste them and would stuff them in under the sink, until the day would come when there",The Handmaids Tale,"Atwood, Margaret"
2247,"would be too many and I would open the cupboard door and they would bulge out, sliding over the floor. Luke used to complain about it. Periodically",The Handmaids Tale,"Atwood, Margaret"
2248,he would take all the bags and throw them out.,The Handmaids Tale,"Atwood, Margaret"
2249,"She could get one of those over her head, hed say. You know how kids like to play. She never would, Id say. Shes too old. (Or too smart, or
too lucky.) But I would feel a chill of fear, and then guilt for having been so careless. It was true, I took too much for granted; I trusted fate, back then.
Ill keep them in a higher cupboard, Id say. Dont keep them at all, hed say. We never use them for anything. Garbage bags, Id say. Hed say...
Not here and now. Not where people are looking. I turn, see my silhouette in the plate glass window. We have come outside, then, we are on
the street.

A group of people is coming towards us. Theyre tourists, from Japan it looks like, a trade delegation perhaps, on a tour of the historic",The Handmaids Tale,"Atwood, Margaret"
2250,"landmarks or out for local color. Theyre diminutive and neatly turned out; each has his or her camera, his or her smile.

2251,"skirts that short on women. The skirts reach just below the knee and the legs come out from beneath them, nearly naked in their thin stockings,",The Handmaids Tale,"Atwood, Margaret"

2253,"on stilts, but off balance; their backs arch at the waist, thrusting the buttocks out. Their heads are uncovered and their hair too is exposed, in all its",The Handmaids Tale,"Atwood, Margaret"

2255,"I stop walking. Ofglen stops beside me and I know that she too cannot take her eyes off these women. We are fascinated, but also repelled.",The Handmaids Tale,"Atwood, Margaret"
2256,"They seem undressed. It has taken so little time to change our minds, about things like this.",The Handmaids Tale,"Atwood, Margaret"

2262,"Excuse me, he says to both of us, politely enough. They're asking if they can take your picture.",The Handmaids Tale,"Atwood, Margaret"

I also know better than to say yes. Modesty is invisibility, said Aunt Lydia. Never forget it. To be seen î to be seen î is to be î her voice

2267,"Im looking down, at the sidewalk, mesmerized by the womens feet. One of them is wearing open-toed sandals, the toenails painted pink. I",The Handmaids Tale,"Atwood, Margaret"

2271,"Excuse me, says the interpreter again, to catch our attention. I nod, to show Ive heard him.
""He asks, are you happy,"" says the interpreter. I can imagine it, their curiosity: Are they happy? How can they be happy? I can feel their bright
black eyes on us, the way they lean a little forward to catch our answers, the women especially, but the men too: we are secret, forbidden, we excite
them.
Ofglen says nothing. There is a silence. But sometimes its as dangerous not to speak.",The Handmaids Tale,"Atwood, Margaret"
2272,"Yes, we are very happy, I murmur. I have to say something. What else can I say?",The Handmaids Tale,"Atwood, Margaret"
2273,CHAPTER 6,The Handmaids Tale,"Atwood, Margaret"
2274,"A block past All Flesh, Ofglen pauses, as if hesitant about which way to go. We have a choice. We could go straight back, or we could walk the",The Handmaids Tale,"Atwood, Margaret"
2275,"long way around. We already know which way we will take, because we always take it.",The Handmaids Tale,"Atwood, Margaret"
2276,"I'd like to pass by the church, says Ofglen, as if piously.",The Handmaids Tale,"Atwood, Margaret"
2277,"All right, I say, though I know as well as she does what shes really after.
We walk, sedately. The sun is out, in the sky there are white fluffy clouds, the kind that look like headless sheep. Given our wings, our blinkers,
its hard to look up, hard to get the full view, of the sky, of anything. But we can do it, a little at a time, a quick move of the head, up and down, to the",The Handmaids Tale,"Atwood, Margaret"
2278,side and back. We have learned to see the world in gasps.,The Handmaids Tale,"Atwood, Margaret"
2279,"To the right, if you could walk along, theres a street that would take you down towards the river. Theres a boathouse, where they kept the sculls",The Handmaids Tale,"Atwood, Margaret"
2280,"once, and some bridges; trees, green banks, where you could sit and watch the water, and the young men with their naked arms, their oars lifting",The Handmaids Tale,"Atwood, Margaret"
2281,"into the sunlight as they played at winning. On the way to the river are the old dormitories, used for something else now, with their fairy-tale turrets,",The Handmaids Tale,"Atwood, Margaret"
2282,"painted white and gold and blue. When we think of the past its the beautiful things we pick out. We want to believe it was all like that.
The football stadium is that way too, where they hold the Mens Salvagings. As well as the football games. They still have those.",The Handmaids Tale,"Atwood, Margaret"
2283,"I dont go to the river anymore, or over bridges. Or on the subway, although theres a station right there. Were not allowed on, there are
Guardians now, theres no official reason for us to go down those steps, ride on the trains under the river, into the main city. Why would we want to",The Handmaids Tale,"Atwood, Margaret"
2284,go from here to there? We would be up to no good and they would know it.,The Handmaids Tale,"Atwood, Margaret"
2285,"The church is a small one, one of the first erected here, hundreds of years ago. It isnt used anymore, except as a museum. Inside it you can
see paintings, of women in long somber dresses, their hair covered by white caps, and of upright men, darkly clothed and unsmiling. Our ancestors.

Admission is free.
We dont go in, though, but stand on the path, looking at the churchyard. The old gravestones are still there, weathered, eroding, with their skulls",The Handmaids Tale,"Atwood, Margaret"
2286,"and crossed bones, memento mori, their dough-faced angels, their winged hourglasses to remind us of the passing of mortal time, and, from a",The Handmaids Tale,"Atwood, Margaret"
2287,"later century, their urns and willow trees, for mourning.",The Handmaids Tale,"Atwood, Margaret"
2288,"They havent fiddled with the gravestones, or the church either. Its only the more recent history that offends them.",The Handmaids Tale,"Atwood, Margaret"
2289,"Ofglens head is bowed, as if shes praying. She does this every time. Maybe, I think, theres someone, someone in particular gone, for her too;
a man, a child. But I cant entirely believe it. I think of her as a woman for whom every act is done for show, is acting rather than a real act. She does",The Handmaids Tale,"Atwood, Margaret"
2290,"such things to look good, I think. Shes out to make the best of it.
But that is what I must look like to her, as well. How can it be otherwise?
Now we turn our backs on the church and there is the thing weve in truth come to see: the Wall.",The Handmaids Tale,"Atwood, Margaret"
2291,"The Wall is hundreds of years old too; or over a hundred, at least. Like the sidewalks, its red brick, and must once have been plain but
handsome. Now the gates have sentries and there are ugly new floodlights mounted on metal posts above it, and barbed wire along the bottom and
broken glass set in concrete along the top.
No one goes through those gates willingly, the precautions are for those trying to get out, though to make it even as far as the Wall, from the
inside, past the electronic alarm system, would be next to impossible.
Beside the main gateway there are six more bodies hanging, by the necks, their hands tied in front of them, their heads in white bags tipped
sideways onto their shoulders. There must have been a Mens Salvaging early this morning. I didnt hear the bells. Perhaps Ive become used to",The Handmaids Tale,"Atwood, Margaret"
2292,them.,The Handmaids Tale,"Atwood, Margaret"
2293,"We stop, together as if on signal, and stand and look at the bodies. It doesnt matter if we look. Were supposed to look: this is what they are",The Handmaids Tale,"Atwood, Margaret"
2294,"there for, hanging on the Wall. Sometimes theyll be there for days, until theres a new batch, so as many people as possible will have the chance to",The Handmaids Tale,"Atwood, Margaret"
2295,see them.,The Handmaids Tale,"Atwood, Margaret"
2296,"What they are hanging from is hooks. The hooks have been set into the brickwork of the Wall, for this purpose. Not all of them are occupied.",The Handmaids Tale,"Atwood, Margaret"
2297,"The hooks look like appliances for the armless. Or steel question marks, upside-down and sideways.",The Handmaids Tale,"Atwood, Margaret"
2298,"Its the bags over the heads that are the worst, worse than the faces themselves would be. It makes the men like dolls on which the faces have
not yet been painted; like scarecrows, which in a way is what they are, since they are meant to scare. Or as if their heads are sacks, stuffed with
some undifferentiated material, like flour or dough. Its the obvious heaviness of the heads, their vacancy, the way gravity pulls them down and",The Handmaids Tale,"Atwood, Margaret"
2299,"theres no life anymore to hold them up. The heads are zeros.
Though if you look and look, as we are doing, you can see the outlines of the features under the white cloth, like gray shadows. The heads are
the heads of snowmen, with the coal eyes and the carrot noses fallen out. The heads are melting.
But on one bag theres blood, which has seeped through the white cloth, where the mouth must have been. It makes another mouth, a small red",The Handmaids Tale,"Atwood, Margaret"
2300,"one, like the mouths painted with thick brushes by kindergarten children. A childs idea of a smile. This smile of blood is what fixes the attention,
finally. These are not snowmen after all.
The men wear white coats, like those worn by doctors or scientists. Doctors and scientists arent the only ones, there are others, but they must",The Handmaids Tale,"Atwood, Margaret"
2301,have had a run on them this morning. Each has a placard hung around his neck to show why he has been executed: a drawing of a human fetus.,The Handmaids Tale,"Atwood, Margaret"
2302,"They were doctors, then, in the time before, when such things were legal. Angel makers, they used to call them; or was that something else?",The Handmaids Tale,"Atwood, Margaret"
2303,"Theyve been turned up now by searches through hospital records, or, or î more likely, since most hospitals destroyed such records once it
became clear what was going to happen î by informants: ex-nurses perhaps, or a pair of them, since evidence from a single woman is no longer
admissible; or another doctor, hoping to save his own skin; or someone already accused, lashing out at an enemy, or at random, in some
desperate bid for safety. Though informants are not always pardoned.
These men, weve been told, are like war criminals. Its no excuse that what they did was legal at the time: their crimes are retroactive. They
have committed atrocities and must be made into examples, for the rest. Though this is hardly needed. No woman in her right mind, these days,
would seek to prevent a birth, should she be so lucky as to conceive.
What we are supposed to feel towards these bodies is hatred and scorn. This isnt what I feel. These bodies hanging on the Wall are time",The Handmaids Tale,"Atwood, Margaret"
2304,"travelers, anachronisms. Theyve come here from the past.
What I feel towards them is blankness. What I feel is that I must not feel. What I feel is partly relief, because none of these men is Luke. Luke
wasnt a doctor. Isnt.

I look at the one red smile. The red of the smile is the same as the red of the tulips in Serena Joys garden, towards the base of the flowers",The Handmaids Tale,"Atwood, Margaret"
2305,"where they are beginning to heal. The red is the same but there is no connection. The tulips are not tulips of blood, the red smiles are not flowers,",The Handmaids Tale,"Atwood, Margaret"
2306,"neither thing makes a comment or the other. The tulip is not a reason for disbelief in the hanged man, or vice versa. Each thing is valid and really",The Handmaids Tale,"Atwood, Margaret"
2307,"there. It is through a field of such valid objects that I must pick my way, every day and in every way. I put a lot of effort into making such distinctions I",The Handmaids Tale,"Atwood, Margaret"
2308,"need to make them. I need to be very clear, in my own mind,",The Handmaids Tale,"Atwood, Margaret"

clenched, I note, tight around the handle of my basket, I wont give anything away.",The Handmaids Tale,"Atwood, Margaret"

speculation. I dont really know what men used to say. I had only their words for it.",The Handmaids Tale,"Atwood, Margaret"
2314,"I lie, then, inside the room, under the plaster eye in the ceiling, behind the white curtains, between the sheets, neatly as they, and step sideways",The Handmaids Tale,"Atwood, Margaret"

2325,"She got it herself and tossed it at me. Im borrowing five bucks off you, okay?

Or in a park somewhere, with my mother. How old was I? It was cold, our breaths came out in front of us, there were no leaves on the trees;
gray sky, two ducks in the pond, disconsolate. Breadcrumbs under my fingers, in my pocket. Thats it: she said we were going to feed the ducks.",The Handmaids Tale,"Atwood, Margaret"
2326,"But there were some women burning books, thats what she was really there for. To see her friends; shed lied to me, Saturdays were",The Handmaids Tale,"Atwood, Margaret"

2328,"There were some men, too, among the women, and the books were magazines. They must have poured gasoline, because the flames shot",The Handmaids Tale,"Atwood, Margaret"

2330,"Their faces were happy, ecstatic almost. Fire can do that. Even my mothers face, usually pale, thinnish, looked ruddy and cheerful, like a
Christmas card; and there was another woman, large, with a soot smear down her cheek and an orange knitted cap, I remember her.
You want to throw one on, honey? she said. How old was I?
Good riddance to bad rubbish, she said, chuckling. It okay? she said to my mother.
It she wants to, my mother said; she had a way of talking about me to others as if I couldnt hear.",The Handmaids Tale,"Atwood, Margaret"

Dont let her see it, said my mother. Here, she said to me, toss it in, quick.",The Handmaids Tale,"Atwood, Margaret"

But then what happens, but then what happens?
I know I lost time.
There must have been needles, pills, something like that. I couldnt have lost that much time without help. You have had a shock, they said.",The Handmaids Tale,"Atwood, Margaret"

2349,"The good weather holds. Its almost like June, when we would get out our sundresses and our sandals and go for an ice cream cone. There are
three new bodies on the Wall. One is a priest, still wearing the black cassock. Thats been put on him, for the trial, even though they gave up",The Handmaids Tale,"Atwood, Margaret"
2350,"wearing those years ago, when the sect wars first began; cassocks made them too conspicuous. The two others have purple placards hung around",The Handmaids Tale,"Atwood, Margaret"
2351,"their necks: Gender Treachery. Their bodies still wear the Guardian uniforms. Caught together, they must have been, but where? A barracks, a",The Handmaids Tale,"Atwood, Margaret"
2352,"shower? Its hard to say. The snowman with the red smile is gone.
""We should go back,"" I say to Ofglen. Im always the one to say this. Sometimes I feel that if I didnt say it, she would stay here forever. But is
she mourning or gloating? I still cant tell.",The Handmaids Tale,"Atwood, Margaret"
2353,"Without a word she swivels, as if shes voice-activated, as if shes on little oiled wheels, as if shes on top of a music box, I resent this grace of
hers. I resent her meek head, bowed as if onto a heavy wind. But there is no wind.
We leave the Wall, walk back the way we came, in the warm sun.
""Its a beautiful May day, Ofglen says. I feel rather than see her head turn towards me, waiting for a reply.
Yes, I say. Praise be, I add as an afterthought. Mayday used to be a distress signal, a long time ago, in one of those wars we studied in
high school. I kept getting them mixed up, but you could tell them apart by the airplanes if you paid attention. It was Luke who told me about mayday,
though. Mayday, mayday, for pilots whose planes had been hit, and ships î was it ships too? î at sea. Maybe it was SOS for ships. I wish I could
look it up. And it was something from Beethoven, for the beginning of the victory, in one of those wars.
Do you know what it came from? said Luke. Mayday?
No, I said. It's a strange word to use for that, isn't it?
Newspapers and coffee, on Sunday mornings, before she was born. There were still newspapers, then. We used to read them in bed.
It's French, he said. From m'aidez.
Help me.

Coming towards us there's a small procession, a funeral: three women, each with a black transparent veil thrown over her headdress. An
Econowife and two others, the mourners, also Econowives, her friends perhaps. Their striped dresses are worn-looking, as are their faces. Some
day, when times improve, says Aunt Lydia, no one will have to be an Econowife.
The first one is the bereaved, the mother; she carries a small black jar. From the size of the jar you can tell how old it was when it foundered,
inside her, flowed to its death. Two or three months, too young to tell whether or not it was an Unbaby. The older ones and those that die at birth
have boxes.
We pause, out of respect, while they go by. I wonder if Ofglen feels what I do, pain like a stab, in the belly. We put our hands over our hearts to
show these stranger women that we feel with them in their loss. Beneath her veil the first one scowls at us. One of the others turns aside, spits on
the sidewalk. The Econowives do not like us.

We go past the shops and come to the barrier again, and are passed through. We continue on among the large empty-looking houses, the
weedless lawns. At the corner near the house where I'm posted, Ofglen stops, turns to me.
Under His Eye, she says. The right farewell.
Under His Eye, I reply, and she gives a little nod. She hesitates, as if to say something more, but then she turns away and walks down the
street. I watch her. She's like my own reflection, in a mirror from which I am moving away.
In the driveway, Nick is polishing the Whirlwind again. He's reached the chrome at the back. I put my gloved hand on the latch of the gate, open
it, push inward. The gate clicks behind me. The tulips along the border are redder than ever, opening, no longer wine cups but chalices; thrusting
themselves up, to what end? They are, after all, empty. When they are old they turn themselves inside out, then explode slowly, the petals thrown out
like shards.
Nick looks up and begins to whistle. Then he says, Nice walk?
I nod, but do not answer with my voice. He isn't supposed to speak to me. Of course some of them will try, said Aunt Lydia. All flesh is weak. All
flesh is grass, I corrected her in my head. They can't help it, she said, God made them that way but He did not make you that way. He made you
different. It's up to you to set the boundaries. Later you will be thanked.
In the garden behind the house the Commander's Wife is sitting, in the chair she's had brought out. Serena Joy, what a stupid name. It's like
something you'd put on your hair, in the other time, the time before, to straighten it. Serena Joy, it would say on the bottle, with a woman's head in
cut-paper silhouette on a pink oval background with scalloped gold edges. With everything to choose from in the way of names, why did she pick
that one? Serena Joy was never her real name, not even then. Her real name was Pam. I read that in a profile on her, in a news magazine, long
after I'd first watched her singing while my mother slept in on Sunday mornings. By that time she was worthy of a profile: Time or Newsweek it was,
it must have been. She wasn't singing anymore by then, she was making speeches. She was good at it. Her speeches were about the sanctity of
the home, about how women should stay home. Serena Joy didn't do this herself, she made speeches instead, but she presented this failure of
hers as a sacrifice she was making for the good of all.
Around that time, someone tried to shoot her and missed; her secretary, who was standing right behind her, was killed instead. Someone else
planted a bomb in her car but it went off too early.
Though some people said she'd put the bomb in her own car, for sympathy. That's how hot things were getting.
Luke and I would watch her sometimes on the late-night news. Bathrobes, nightcaps. We'd watch her sprayed hair and her hysteria, and the
tears she could still produce at will, and the mascara blackening her cheeks. By that time she was wearing more makeup. We thought she was
funny. Or Luke thought she was funny. I only pretended to think so. Really she was a little frightening. She was in earnest.

She doesn't make speeches anymore. She has become speechless. She stays in her home, but it doesn't seem to agree with her. How
furious she must be, now that she's been taken at her word.
She's looking at the tulips. Her cane is beside her, on the grass. Her profile is towards me, I can see that in the quick sideways look I take at
her as I go past. It wouldn't do to stare. It's no longer a flawlesss cut-paper profile, her face is sinking in upon itself, and I think of those towns built on
underground rivers, where houses and whole streets disappear overnight, into sudden quagmires, or coal towns collapsing into the mines beneath
them. Something like this must have happened to her, once she saw the true shape of things to come.
She doesn't turn her head. She doesn't acknowledge my presence in any way, although she knows I'm there. I can tell she knows, it's like a
smell, her knowledge; something gone sour, like old milk.
It's not the husbands you have to watch out for, said Aunt Lydia, it's the Wives. You should always try to imagine what they must be feeling. Of
course they will resent you. It is only natural. Try to feel for them. Aunt Lydia thought she was very good at feeling for other people. Try to pity them.
Forgive them, for they know not what they do. Again the tremulous smile, of a beggar, the weak-eyed blinking, the gaze upwards, through the round
steel-rimmed glasses, towards the back of the classroom, as if the green-painted plaster ceiling were opening and God on a cloud of Pink Pearl
face powder were coming down through the wires and sprinkler plumbing. You must realize that they are defeated women. They have been unable
î
Here her voice broke off, and there was a pause, during which I could hear a sigh, a collective sigh from those around me. It was a bad idea to
rustle or fidget during these pauses: Aunt Lydia might look abstracted but she was aware of every twitch. So there was only the sigh.
The future is in your hands, she resumed. She held her own hands out to us, the ancient gesture that was both an offering and an invitation, to
come forward, into an embrace, an acceptance. In your hands, she said, looking down at her own hands as if they had given her the idea. But there
was nothing in them. They were empty. It was our hands that were supposed to be full, of the future; which could be held but not seen.

I walk around to the back door, open it, go in, set my basket down on the kitchen table. The table has been scrubbed off, cleared of flour;
today's bread, freshly baked, is cooling on its rack. The kitchen smells of yeast, a nostalgic smell. It reminds me of other kitchens, kitchens that
were mine. It smells of mothers; although my own mother did not make bread. It smells of me, in former times, when I was a mother.
This is a treacherous smell, and I know I must shut it out.
Rita is there, sitting at the table, peeling and slicing carrots. Old carrots they are, thick ones, overwintered, bearded from their time in storage.
The new carrots, tender and pale, won't be ready for weeks. The knife she uses is sharp and bright, and tempting. I would like to have a knife like
that.
Rita stops chopping the carrots, stands up, takes the parcels out of the basket, almost eagerly. She looks forward to seeing what I've brought,
although she always frowns while opening the parcels. Nothing I bring fully pleases her. She's thinking she could have done better herself. She
would rather do the shopping, get exactly what she wants; she envies me the walk. In this house we all envy each other something.
Theyve got oranges,"" I say. ""At Milk and Honey. There are still some left."" I hold out this idea to her like an offering, I wish to ingratiate myself. I
saw the oranges yesterday, but I didnt tell Rita; yesterday she was too grumpy. I could get some tomorrow, if you'd give me the tokens for them. I",The Handmaids Tale,"Atwood, Margaret"
2354,"hold out the chicken to her. She wanted steak today, but there wasnt any.
Rita grunts, not revealing pleasure or acceptance. Shell think about it, the grunt says, in her own sweet time. She undoes the string on the",The Handmaids Tale,"Atwood, Margaret"
2355,"chicken, and the glazed paper. She prods the chicken, flexes a wing, pokes a finger into the cavity, fishes out the giblets. The chicken lies there,",The Handmaids Tale,"Atwood, Margaret"

2360,"There wasn't much else, I say. Rita ignores me.",The Handmaids Tale,"Atwood, Margaret"
2361,"Looks big enough to me, says Cora. Is she standing up for me? I look at her, to see if I should smile; but no, its only the food shes thinking of.",The Handmaids Tale,"Atwood, Margaret"
2362,"Shes younger than Rita; the sunlight, coming slant now through the west window, catches her hair, parted and drawn back. She must have been
pretty, quite recently. Theres a little mark, like a dimple, in each of her ears, where the punctures for earrings have grown over.",The Handmaids Tale,"Atwood, Margaret"
2363,"Tall, says Rita, but bony. You should speak up, she says to me, looking directly at me for the first time. Ain't like you're common. She",The Handmaids Tale,"Atwood, Margaret"
2364,"means the Commanders rank. But in the other sense, her sense, she thinks I am common. She is over sixty, her minds made up.",The Handmaids Tale,"Atwood, Margaret"
2365,"She goes to the sink, runs her hands briefly under the tap, dries them on the dishtowel. The dishtowel is white with blue stripes. Dishtowels are",The Handmaids Tale,"Atwood, Margaret"
2366,"the same as they always were. Sometimes these flashes of normality come at me from the side, like ambushes. The ordinary, the usual, a",The Handmaids Tale,"Atwood, Margaret"
2367,"reminder, like a kick. I see the dishtowel, out of context, and I catch my breath. For some, in some ways, things havent changed that much.
""Whos doing the bath? says Rita, to Cora, not to me. I got to tenderize this bird.
Ill do it later,"" says Cora, ""after the dusting.""
""Just so it gets done,"" says Rita.
Theyre talking about me as though I cant hear. To them Im a household chore, one among many.",The Handmaids Tale,"Atwood, Margaret"
2368,"Ive been dismissed. I pick up the basket, go through the kitchen door and along the hall towards the grandfather clock. The sitting room door is
closed. Sun comes through the fanlight, falling in colors across the floor: red and blue, purple. I step into it briefly, stretch out my hands; they fill with
flowers of light. I go up the stairs, my face, distant and white and distorted, framed in the hall mirror, which bulges outward like an eye under
pressure. I follow the dusty-pink runner down the long upstairs hallway, back to the room.

Theres someone standing in the hall, near the door to the room where I stay. The hall is dusky, this is a man, his back to me; hes looking into
the room, dark against its light. I can see now, its the Commander, he isnt supposed to be here. He hears me coming, turns, hesitates, walks
forward. Towards me. He is violating custom, what do I do now?
I stop, he pauses, I cant see his face, hes looking at me, what does he want? But then he moves forward again, steps to the side to avoid
touching me, inclines his head, is gone.

Something has been shown to me, but what is it? Like the flag of an unknown country, seen for an instant above a curve of hill. It could mean
attack, it could mean parley, it could mean the edge of something, a territory. The signals animals give one another: lowered blue eyelids, ears laid
back, raised hackles. A flash of bared teeth, what in hell does he think hes doing? Nobody else has seen him. I hope. Was he invading? Was he in",The Handmaids Tale,"Atwood, Margaret"

2376,I discovered it three days after I was moved here.,The Handmaids Tale,"Atwood, Margaret"
2377,"I had a lot of time to pass. I decided to explore the room. Not hastily, as one would explore a hotel room, expecting no surprise, opening and",The Handmaids Tale,"Atwood, Margaret"
2378,"shutting the desk drawers, the cupboard doors, unwrapping the tiny individually wrapped bar of soap, prodding the pillows. Will I ever be in a hotel",The Handmaids Tale,"Atwood, Margaret"

2381,"In the afternoons, when Luke was still in flight from his wife, when I was still imaginary for him. Before we were married and I solidified. I would",The Handmaids Tale,"Atwood, Margaret"
2382,"always get there first, check in. It wasnt that many times, but it seems now like a decade, an era; I can remember what I wore, each blouse, each
scarf. I would pace, waiting for him, turn the television on and then off, dab behind my ears with perfume, Opium it was. It was in a Chinese bottle,
red and gold.
I was nervous. How was I to know he loved me? It might be just an affair. Why did we ever say just? Though at that time men and women tried
each other on, casually, like suits, rejecting whatever did not fit.
The knock would come at the door; Id open, with relief, desire. He was so momentary, so condensed. And yet there seemed no end to him.",The Handmaids Tale,"Atwood, Margaret"
2383,"We would lie in those afternoon beds, afterwards, hands on each other, talking it over. Possible, impossible. What could be done? We thought we",The Handmaids Tale,"Atwood, Margaret"
2384,had such problems. How were we to know we were happy?,The Handmaids Tale,"Atwood, Margaret"
2385,"But now its the rooms themselves I miss as well, even the dreadful paintings that hung on the walls, landscapes with fall foliage or snow melting
in hardwoods, or women in period costume, with china-doll faces and bustles and parasols, or sad-eyed clowns, or bowls of fruit, stiff and chalky
looking. The fresh towels ready for spoilage, the wastebaskets gaping their invitations, beckoning in the careless junk. Careless. I was careless, in
those rooms. I could lift the telephone and food would appear on a tray, food I had chosen. Food that was bad for me, no doubt, and drink too.
There were Bibles in the dresser drawers, put there by some charitable society, though probably no one read them very much. There were
postcards, too, with pictures of the hotel on them, and you could write on the postcards and send them to anyone you wanted. It seems like such an
impossible thing, now; like something youd make up.",The Handmaids Tale,"Atwood, Margaret"
2386,"So. I explored this room, not hastily, then, like a hotel room, wasting it. I didnt want to do it all at once, I wanted to make it last. I divided the
room into sections, in my head; I allowed myself one section a day. This one section I would examine with the greatest minuteness: the unevenness
of the plaster under the wallpaper, the scratches in the paint of the baseboard and the windowsill, under the top coat of paint, the stains on the
mattress, for I went so far as to lift the blankets and sheets from the bed, fold them back, a little at a time, so they could be replaced quickly if
anyone came.
The stains on the mattress. Like dried flower petals. Not recent. Old love; theres no other kind of love in this room now.",The Handmaids Tale,"Atwood, Margaret"
2387,"When I saw that, the evidence left by two people, of love or something like it, desire at least, at least touch, between two people now perhaps",The Handmaids Tale,"Atwood, Margaret"
2388,"old or dead, I covered the bed again and lay down on it. I looked up at the blind plaster eye in the ceiling. I wanted to feel Luke lying beside me. I",The Handmaids Tale,"Atwood, Margaret"
2389,"have them, these attacks of the past, like faintness, a wave sweeping over my head. Sometimes it can hardly be borne. What is to be done, what is",The Handmaids Tale,"Atwood, Margaret"
2390,"to be done, I thought. There is nothing to be done. They also serve who only stand and wait. Or lie down and wait. I know why the glass in the",The Handmaids Tale,"Atwood, Margaret"
2391,"window is shatterproof, and why they took down the chandelier. I wanted to feel Luke lying beside me, but there wasnt room.

I saved the cupboard until the third day. I looked carefully over the door first, inside and out, then the walls with their brass hooks î how could
they have overlooked the hooks? Why didnt they remove them? Too close to the floor? But still, a stocking, thats all youd need. And the rod with",The Handmaids Tale,"Atwood, Margaret"
2392,"the plastic hangers, my dresses hanging on them, the red woollen cape for cold weather, the shawl. I knelt to examine the floor, and there it was, in",The Handmaids Tale,"Atwood, Margaret"
2393,"tiny writing, quite fresh it seemed, scratched with a pin or maybe just a fingernail, in the corner where the darkest shadow fell: Nolite te bastardes",The Handmaids Tale,"Atwood, Margaret"
2394,carborundorum.,The Handmaids Tale,"Atwood, Margaret"
2395,"I didnt know what it meant, or even what language it was in. I thought it might be Latin, but I didnt know any Latin. Still, it was a message, and it",The Handmaids Tale,"Atwood, Margaret"
2396,"was in writing, forbidden by that very fact, and it hadnt yet been discovered. Except by me, for whom it was intended. It was intended for whoever
came next.
It pleases me to ponder this message. It pleases me to think Im communing with her, this unknown woman. For she is unknown; or if known,",The Handmaids Tale,"Atwood, Margaret"
2397,"she has never been mentioned to me. It pleases me to know that her taboo message made it through, to at least one other person, washed itself up",The Handmaids Tale,"Atwood, Margaret"
2398,"on the wall of my cupboard, was opened and read by me. Sometimes I repeat the words to myself. They give me a small joy. When I imagine the",The Handmaids Tale,"Atwood, Margaret"
2399,"woman who wrote them, I think of her as about my age, maybe a little younger. I turn her into Moira, Moira as she was when she was in college, in",The Handmaids Tale,"Atwood, Margaret"
2400,"the room next to mine: quirky, jaunty, athletic, with a bicycle once, and a knapsack for hiking. Freckles, I think; irreverent, resourceful.",The Handmaids Tale,"Atwood, Margaret"
2401,"I wonder who she was or is, and whats become of her.
I tried that out on Rita, the day I found the message.
Who was the woman who stayed in that room? I said. Before me? If Id asked it differently, if Id said, Was there a woman who stayed in that
room before me? I might not have got anywhere.

Which one? she said; she sounded grudging, suspicious, but then, she almost always sounds like that when she speaks to me.
So there have been more than one. Some havent stayed their full term of posting, their full two years. Some have been sent away, for one",The Handmaids Tale,"Atwood, Margaret"
2402,reason or another. Or maybe not sent; gone?,The Handmaids Tale,"Atwood, Margaret"
2403,The lively one. I was guessing. The one with freckles.,The Handmaids Tale,"Atwood, Margaret"
2404,"You know her? Rita asked, more suspicious than ever.",The Handmaids Tale,"Atwood, Margaret"
2405,"I knew her before, I lied. I heard she was here.",The Handmaids Tale,"Atwood, Margaret"
2406,"Rita accepted this. She knows there must be a grapevine, an underground of sorts.",The Handmaids Tale,"Atwood, Margaret"
2407,"She didnt work out, she said.
In what way? I asked, trying to sound as neutral as possible.
But Rita clamped her lips together. I am like a child here, there are some things I must not be told. What you dont know wont hurt you, was all
she would say.

CHAPTER 10
Sometimes I sing to myself, in my head; something lugubrious, mournful, presbyterian:

Amazing grace, how sweet the sound
Could save a wretch like me,
Who once was lost, but now am found,
Was bound, but now am free.
I dont know if the words are right. I cant remember. Such songs are not sung anymore in public, especially the ones that use words like free.
They are considered too dangerous. They belong to outlawed sects.

I feel so lonely, baby,
I feel so lonely, baby,
I feel so lonely I could die.
This too is outlawed. I know it from an old cassette tape of my mothers; she had a scratchy and untrustworthy machine, too, that could still play",The Handmaids Tale,"Atwood, Margaret"
2408,"such things. She used to put the tape on when her friends came over and theyd had a few drinks.
I dont sing like this often. It makes my throat hurt.",The Handmaids Tale,"Atwood, Margaret"
2409,"There isnt much music in this house, except what we hear on the TV. Sometimes Rita will hum, while kneading or peeling: a wordless
humming, tuneless, unfathomable. And sometimes from the front sitting room there will be the thin sound of Serenas voice, from a disc made long",The Handmaids Tale,"Atwood, Margaret"
2410,"ago and played now with the volume low, so she wont be caught listening as she sits in there knitting, remembering her own former and now
amputated glory: Hallelujah.

Its warm for the time of year. Houses like this heat up in the sun, theres not enough insulation. Around me the air is stagnant, despite the little
current, the breath coming in past the curtains. Id like to be able to open the window as wide as it could go. Soon well be allowed to change into
the summer dresses.
The summer dresses are unpacked and hanging in the closet, two of them, pure cotton, which is better than synthetics like the cheaper ones,
though even so, when its muggy, in July and August, you sweat inside them. No worry about sunburn though, said Aunt Lydia. The spectacles",The Handmaids Tale,"Atwood, Margaret"
2411,"women used to make of themselves. Oiling themselves like roast meat on a spit, and bare backs and shoulders, on the street, in public, and legs,",The Handmaids Tale,"Atwood, Margaret"
2412,"not even stockings on them, no wonder those things used to happen. Things, the word she used when whatever it stood for was too distasteful or",The Handmaids Tale,"Atwood, Margaret"
2413,"filthy or horrible to pass her lips. A successful life for her was one that avoided things, excluded things. Such things do not happen to nice women.",The Handmaids Tale,"Atwood, Margaret"

2416,"us, in full view.",The Handmaids Tale,"Atwood, Margaret"
2417,"Im doing my best, she said. Im trying to give you the best chance you can have. She blinked, the light was too strong for her, her mouth",The Handmaids Tale,"Atwood, Margaret"
2418,"trembled, around her front teeth, teeth that stuck out a little and were long and yellowish, and I thought about the dead mice we would find on the",The Handmaids Tale,"Atwood, Margaret"

Dont think its easy for me either, said Aunt Lydia.

Moira, breezing into my room, dropping her denim jacket on the floor. Got any cigs, she said.
In my purse, I said. No matches though.
Moira rummages in my purse. You should throw out some of this junk, she says. Im giving an underwhore party.",The Handmaids Tale,"Atwood, Margaret"

lights the cigarette shes extracted from my purse. Want one? Tosses the package, with great generosity, considering theyre mine.
Thanks piles, I say sourly. Youre crazy. Whered you get an idea like that?
Working my way through college, says Moira. Ive got connections. Friends of my mothers. Its big in the suburbs, once they start getting age",The Handmaids Tale,"Atwood, Margaret"

Im laughing. She always made me laugh.",The Handmaids Tale,"Atwood, Margaret"

Youre never too young to learn, she says. Come on, itll be great. Well all pee in our pants laughing.",The Handmaids Tale,"Atwood, Margaret"
2426,"Is that how we lived, then? But we lived as usual. Everyone does, most of the time. Whatever is going on is as usual. Even this is as usual, now.",The Handmaids Tale,"Atwood, Margaret"
2427,"We lived, as usual, by ignoring. Ignoring isnt the same as ignorance, you have to work at it.
Nothing changes instantaneously: in a gradually heating bathtub youd be boiled to death before you knew it. There were stories in the",The Handmaids Tale,"Atwood, Margaret"
2428,"newspapers, of course, corpses in ditches or the woods, bludgeoned to death or mutilated, interfered with, as they used to say, but they were about",The Handmaids Tale,"Atwood, Margaret"
2429,"other women, and the men who did such things were other men. None of them were the men we knew. The newspaper stories were like dreams to",The Handmaids Tale,"Atwood, Margaret"
2430,"us, bad dreams dreamt by others. How awful, we would say, and they were, but they were awful without being believable. They were too",The Handmaids Tale,"Atwood, Margaret"
2431,"melodramatic, they had a dimension that was not the dimension of our lives.",The Handmaids Tale,"Atwood, Margaret"
2432,We were the people who were not in the papers. We lived in the blank white spaces at the edges of print. It gave us more freedom.,The Handmaids Tale,"Atwood, Margaret"
2433,We lived in the gaps between the stories.,The Handmaids Tale,"Atwood, Margaret"
2434,"From below, from the driveway, comes the sound of the car being started. Its quiet in this area, there isnt a lot of traffic, you can hear things",The Handmaids Tale,"Atwood, Margaret"
2435,"like that very clearly: car motors, lawn mowers, the clipping of a hedge, the slam of a door. You could hear a shout clearly, or a shot, if such noises",The Handmaids Tale,"Atwood, Margaret"
2436,were ever made here. Sometimes there are distant sirens.,The Handmaids Tale,"Atwood, Margaret"
2437,"I go to the window and sit on the window seat, which is too narrow for comfort. Theres a hard little cushion on it, with a petit point cover: FAITH,
in square print, surrounded by a wreath of lilies. FAITH is a faded blue, the leaves of the lilies a dingy green. This is a cushion once used elsewhere,
worn but not enough to throw out. Somehow its been overlooked.",The Handmaids Tale,"Atwood, Margaret"
2438,"I can spend minutes, tens of minutes, running my eyes over the print: FAITH. Its the only thing theyve given me to read. If I were caught doing it,",The Handmaids Tale,"Atwood, Margaret"
2439,"would it count? I didnt put the cushion here myself.
The motor turns, and I lean forward, pulling the white curtain across my face, like a veil. Its semisheer, I can see through it. If I press my",The Handmaids Tale,"Atwood, Margaret"
2440,"forehead against the glass and look down, I can see the back half of the Whirlwind. Nobody is there, but as I watch I see Nick come around to the",The Handmaids Tale,"Atwood, Margaret"
2441,"back door of the car, open it, stand stiffly beside it. His cap is straight now and his sleeves rolled down and buttoned. I cant see his face because
Im looking down on him.",The Handmaids Tale,"Atwood, Margaret"
2442,"Now the Commander is coming out. I glimpse him only for an instant, foreshortened, walking to the car. He doest have his hat on, so its not a",The Handmaids Tale,"Atwood, Margaret"
2443,"formal event hes going to. His hair is a gray. Silver, you might call it if you were being kind. I dont feel like being kind. The one before this was bald,",The Handmaids Tale,"Atwood, Margaret"
2444,"so I suppose hes an improvement.
If I could spit, out the window, or throw something, the cushion for instance, I might be able to hit him.

Moira and I, with paper bags filled with water. Water bombs, they were called. Leaning out my dorm window, dropping them on the heads of
the boys below. It was Moiras idea. What were they trying to do? Climb a ladder, for something. For our underwear.",The Handmaids Tale,"Atwood, Margaret"
2445,"That dormitory had once been co-educational, there were still urinals in one of the washrooms on our floor. But by the time Id got there theyd",The Handmaids Tale,"Atwood, Margaret"
2446,put things back the way they were.,The Handmaids Tale,"Atwood, Margaret"
2447,"The Commander stoops, gets into the car, disappears, and Nick shuts the door. A moment later the car moves backward, down the driveway",The Handmaids Tale,"Atwood, Margaret"
2448,"and onto the street, and vanishes behind the hedge.",The Handmaids Tale,"Atwood, Margaret"
2449,"I ought to feel hatred for this man. I know I ought to feel it, but it isnt what I do feel. What I feel is more complicated than that. I dont know what to",The Handmaids Tale,"Atwood, Margaret"
2450,"call it. It isnt love.

CHAPTER 11
Yesterday morning I went to the doctor. Was taken, by a Guardian, one of those with the red arm bands who are in charge of such things. We
rode in a red car, him in the front, me in the back. No twin went with me; on these occasions Im solitaire.",The Handmaids Tale,"Atwood, Margaret"
2451,"Im taken to the doctors once a month, for tests: urine, hormones, cancer smear, blood test; the same as before, except that now its obligatory.
The doctors office is in a modern office building. We ride up in the elevator, silently, the Guardian facing me. In the black-mirror wall of the",The Handmaids Tale,"Atwood, Margaret"
2452,"elevator I can see the back of his head. At the office itself, I go in; he waits, outside in the hall, with the other Guardians, on one of the chairs placed",The Handmaids Tale,"Atwood, Margaret"
2453,there for that purpose.,The Handmaids Tale,"Atwood, Margaret"
2454,"Inside the waiting room there are other women, three of them, in red: this doctor is a specialist. Covertly we regard each other, sizing up each",The Handmaids Tale,"Atwood, Margaret"
2455,"others bellies: is anyone lucky? The nurse records our names and the numbers from our passes on the Compudoc, to see if we are who we are
supposed to be. Hes six feet tall, about forty, a diagonal scar across his cheek; he sits typing, his hands too big for the keyboard, still wearing his",The Handmaids Tale,"Atwood, Margaret"
2456,pistol in the shoulder holster.,The Handmaids Tale,"Atwood, Margaret"
2457,"When Im called I go through the doorway into the inner room. Its white, featureless, like the outer one, except for the folding screen, red cloth",The Handmaids Tale,"Atwood, Margaret"
2458,"stretched on a frame, a gold Eye painted on it, with a snake-twined sword upright beneath it, like a sort of handle. The snakes and the sword are",The Handmaids Tale,"Atwood, Margaret"
2459,bits of broken symbolism left over from the time before.,The Handmaids Tale,"Atwood, Margaret"
2460,"After Ive filled the small bottle left ready for me in the little washroom, I take off my clothes, behind the screen, and leave them folded on the
chair. When Im naked I lie down on the examining table, on the sheet of chilly crackling disposable paper. I pull the second sheet, the cloth one, up",The Handmaids Tale,"Atwood, Margaret"
2461,"over my body. At neck level theres another sheet, suspended from the ceiling. It intersects me so that the doctor will never see my face. He deals
with a torso only.
When Im arranged I reach my hand out, fumble for the small lever at the right side of the table, pull it back. Somewhere else a bell rings,",The Handmaids Tale,"Atwood, Margaret"
2462,"unheard by me. After a minute the door opens, footsteps come in, there is breathing. He isnt supposed to speak to me except when its absolutely",The Handmaids Tale,"Atwood, Margaret"
2463,necessary. But this doctor is talkative.,The Handmaids Tale,"Atwood, Margaret"
2464,"How are we getting along? he says, some tic of speech from the other time. The sheet is lifted from my skin, a draft pimples me. A cold",The Handmaids Tale,"Atwood, Margaret"
2465,"finger, rubber-clad and jellied, slides into me, I am poked and prodded. The finger retreats, enters otherwise, withdraws.",The Handmaids Tale,"Atwood, Margaret"
2466,"Nothing wrong with you, the doctor says, as if to himself. Any pain, honey? He calls me honey.",The Handmaids Tale,"Atwood, Margaret"
2467,"No, I say.",The Handmaids Tale,"Atwood, Margaret"
2468,"My breasts are fingered in their turn, a search for ripeness, rot. The breathing comes nearer. I smell old smoke, aftershave, tobacco dust on",The Handmaids Tale,"Atwood, Margaret"
2469,"hair. Then the voice, very soft, close to my head: thats him, bulging the sheet.
""I could help you,"" he says. Whispers.
""What?"" I say.
""Shh,"" he says. ""I could help you. Ive helped others.
Help me? I say, my voice as low as his. How? Does he know something, has he seen Luke, has he found, can he bring back?
How do you think? he says, still barely breathing it. Is that his hand, sliding up my leg? He's taken off the glove. The doors locked. No one
will come in. Theyll never know it isnt his.""
He lifts the sheet. The lower part of his face is covered by the white gauze mask, regulation. Two brown eyes, a nose, a head with brown hair
on it. His hand is between my legs. ""Most of those old guys cant make it anymore, he says. Or theyre sterile.""
I almost gasp: hes said a forbidden word. Sterile. There is no such thing as a sterile man anymore, not officially. There are only women who",The Handmaids Tale,"Atwood, Margaret"
2470,"are fruitful and women who are barren, thats the law.
""Lots of women do it,"" he goes on. ""You want a baby, dont you?
Yes, I say. It's true, and I don't ask why, because I know. Give me children, or else I die. There's more than one meaning to it.
Youre soft,"" he says. ""Its time. Today or tomorrow would do it, why waste it? Itd only take a minute, honey."" What he called his wife, once;
maybe still does, but really its a generic term. We are all honey.",The Handmaids Tale,"Atwood, Margaret"
2471,"I hesitate. Hes offering himself to me, his services, at some risk to himself.
""I hate to see what they put you through,"" he murmurs. Its genuine, genuine sympathy; and yet hes enjoying this, sympathy and all. His eyes are
moist with compassion, his hand is moving on me, nervously and with impatience.
""Its too dangerous, I say. No. I cant."" The penalty is death. But they have to catch you in the act, with two witnesses. What are the odds, is the
room bugged, whos waiting just outside the door?",The Handmaids Tale,"Atwood, Margaret"
2472,"His hand stops. Think about it, he says. I've seen your chart. You don't have a lot of time left. But it's your life.",The Handmaids Tale,"Atwood, Margaret"
2473,"Thank you, I say. I must leave the impression that Im not offended, that Im open to suggestion. He takes his hand away, lazily almost,",The Handmaids Tale,"Atwood, Margaret"
2474,"lingeringly, this is not the last word as far as hes concerned. He could fake the tests, report me for cancer, for infertility, have me shipped off to the
Colonies, with the Unwomen.. None of this has been said, but the knowledge of his power hangs nevertheless in the air as he pats my thigh,
withdrew himself behind the hanging sheet.
""Next month,"" he says.
I put on my clothes again, behind the screen, My hands are shaking. Why am I frightened? Ive crossed no boundaries, Ive given no trust, taken
no risk, all is safe. Its the choice that terrifies me. A way out, a salvation.",The Handmaids Tale,"Atwood, Margaret"
2475,CHAPTER 12,The Handmaids Tale,"Atwood, Margaret"
2476,"The bathroom is beside the bedroom. Its papered in small blue flowers, forget-me-nots, with curtains to match. Theres a blue bath mat, a blue",The Handmaids Tale,"Atwood, Margaret"
2477,fake-fur cover on the toilet seat; all this bathroom lacks from the time before is a doll whose skirt conceals the extra roll of toilet paper. Except that,The Handmaids Tale,"Atwood, Margaret"
2478,"the mirror over the sink has been taken out and replaced by an oblong of tin, and the door has no lock, and there are no razors, of course. There",The Handmaids Tale,"Atwood, Margaret"
2479,"were incidents in bathrooms at first: there were cuttings, drownings. Before they got all the bugs ironed out. Cora sits on a chair outside in the hall,",The Handmaids Tale,"Atwood, Margaret"
2480,"to see that no one else goes in. In a bathroom, in a bathtub, you are vulnerable, said Aunt Lydia. She didnt say to what.
The bath is a requirement, but it is also a luxury. Merely to lift off the heavy white wings and the veil, merely to feel my own hair again, with my
hands, is a luxury. My hair is long now, un-trimmed. Hair must be long but covered. Aunt Lydia said: Saint Paul said its either that or a close shave.",The Handmaids Tale,"Atwood, Margaret"
2481,"She laughed, that held-back neighing of hers, as if shed told a joke.
Cora has run the bath. It steams like a bowl of soup. I take off the rest of the clothes, the overdress, the white shift and petticoat, the red
stockings, the loose cotton pantaloons. Pantyhose gives you crotch rot, Moira used to say. Aunt Lydia would never have used an expression like
crotch rot. Unhygienic was hers. She wanted everything to be very hygienic.
My nakedness is strange to me already. My body seems outdated. Did I really wear bathing suits, at the beach? I did, without thought, among
men, without caring that my legs, my arms, my thighs and back were on display, could be seen. Shameful, immodest. I avoid looking down at my
body, not so much because its shameful or immodest but because I dont want to see it. I dont want to look at something that determines me so",The Handmaids Tale,"Atwood, Margaret"
2482,completely.,The Handmaids Tale,"Atwood, Margaret"
2483,"I step into the water, lie down, let it hold me. The water is soft as hands. I close my eyes, and shes there with me, suddenly, without warning, it
must be the smell of the soap. I put my face against the soft hair at the back of her neck and breathe her in, baby powder and childs washed flesh",The Handmaids Tale,"Atwood, Margaret"
2484,"and shampoo, with an undertone, the faint scent of urine. This is the age she is when Im in the bath. She comes back to me at different ages. This
is how I know shes not really a ghost. If she were a ghost she would be the same age always.",The Handmaids Tale,"Atwood, Margaret"
2485,"One day, when she was eleven months old, just before she began to walk, a woman stole her out of a supermarket cart. It was a Saturday,",The Handmaids Tale,"Atwood, Margaret"
2486,"which was when Luke and I did the weeks shopping, because both of us had jobs. She was sitting in the little baby seats they had then, in
supermarket carts, with holes for the legs. She was happy enough, and Id turned my back, the cat food section I think it was; Luke was over at the",The Handmaids Tale,"Atwood, Margaret"
2487,"side of the store, out of sight, at the meat counter. He liked to choose what kind of meat we were going to eat during the week. He said men",The Handmaids Tale,"Atwood, Margaret"
2488,"needed more meat than women did, and that it wasnt a superstition and he wasnt being a jerk, studies had been done. There are some",The Handmaids Tale,"Atwood, Margaret"
2489,"differences, he said. He was fond of saying that, as if I was trying to prove there werent. But mostly he said it when my mother was there. He liked
to tease her.
I heard her start to cry. I turned around and she was disappearing down the aisle, in the arms of a woman Id never seen before. I screamed,",The Handmaids Tale,"Atwood, Margaret"
2490,"and the woman was stopped. She must have been about thirty-five. She was crying and saying it was her baby, the Lord had given it to her, hed
sent her a sign. I felt sorry for her. The store manager apologized and they held her until the police came.
Shes just crazy, Luke said.",The Handmaids Tale,"Atwood, Margaret"
2491,"I thought it was an isolated incident, at the time.",The Handmaids Tale,"Atwood, Margaret"
2492,"She fades, I cant keep her here with me, shes gone now. Maybe I do think of her as a ghost, the ghost of a dead girl, a little girl who died when",The Handmaids Tale,"Atwood, Margaret"
2493,"she was five. I remember the pictures of us I once had, me holding her, standard poses, mother and baby, locked in a frame, for safety. Behind my",The Handmaids Tale,"Atwood, Margaret"
2494,"closed eyes I can see myself as I am now, sitting beside an open drawer, or a trunk, in the cellar, where the baby clothes are folded away, a lock of",The Handmaids Tale,"Atwood, Margaret"
2495,"hair, cut when she was two, in an envelope, white-blond. It got darker later.",The Handmaids Tale,"Atwood, Margaret"
2496,"I dont have those things anymore, the clothes and hair. I wonder what happened to all our things. Looted, dumped out, carried away.
Confiscated.
Ive learned to do without a lot of things. If you have a lot of things, said Aunt Lydia, you get too attached to this material world and you forget",The Handmaids Tale,"Atwood, Margaret"
2497,"about spiritual values. You must cultivate poverty of spirit. Blessed are the meek. She didnt go on to say anything about inheriting the earth.
I lie, lapped by the water, beside an open drawer that does not exist, and think about a girl who did not die when she was five; who still does
exist, I hope, though not for me. Do I exist for her? Am I a picture somewhere, in the dark at the back of her mind?
They must have told her I was dead. Thats what they would think of doing. They would say it would be easier for her to adjust.",The Handmaids Tale,"Atwood, Margaret"
2498,"Eight, she must be now. Ive filled in the time I lost, I know how much theres been. They were right, its easier, to think of her as dead. I dont",The Handmaids Tale,"Atwood, Margaret"
2499,"have to hope then, or make a wasted effort. Why bash your head, said Aunt Lydia, against a wall? Sometimes she had a graphic way of putting",The Handmaids Tale,"Atwood, Margaret"
2500,things.,The Handmaids Tale,"Atwood, Margaret"
2501,"I ain't got all day, says Coras voice outside the door. Its true, she hasnt. She hasnt got all of anything. I must not deprive her of her time. I",The Handmaids Tale,"Atwood, Margaret"
2502,"soap myself, use the scrub brush and the piece of pumice for sanding off dead skin. Such puritan aids are supplied. I wish to be totally clean,",The Handmaids Tale,"Atwood, Margaret"
2503,"germless, without bacteria, like the surface of the moon. I will not be able to wash myself, this evening, not afterwards, not for a day. It interferes,",The Handmaids Tale,"Atwood, Margaret"
2504,"they say, and why take chances?",The Handmaids Tale,"Atwood, Margaret"
2505,"I cannot avoid seeing, now, the small tattoo on my ankle. Four digits and an eye, a passport in reverse. Its supposed to guarantee that I will
never be able to fade, finally, into another landscape. I am too important, too scarce, for that. I am a national resource.
I pull the plug, dry myself, put on my red terrycloth robe. I leave todays dress here, where Cora will pick it up to be washed. Back in the room I",The Handmaids Tale,"Atwood, Margaret"
2506,"dress again. The white headdress isnt necessary for the evening, because I wont be going out. Everyone in this house knows what my face looks",The Handmaids Tale,"Atwood, Margaret"
2507,"like. The red veil goes on, though, covering my damp hair, my head, which has not been shaved. Where did I see that film, about the women,",The Handmaids Tale,"Atwood, Margaret"
2508,"kneeling in the town square, hands holding them, their hair falling in clumps? What had they done? It must have been a long time ago, because I",The Handmaids Tale,"Atwood, Margaret"
2509,"cant remember.
Cora brings my supper, covered, on a tray. She knocks at the door before entering. I like her for that. It means she thinks I have some of what
we used to call privacy left.
""Thank you,"" I say, taking the tray from her, and she actually smiles at me, but she turns away without answering. When were alone together",The Handmaids Tale,"Atwood, Margaret"
2510,"shes shy of me.
I put the tray on the small white-painted table and draw the chair up to it. I take the cover off the tray. The thigh of a chicken, overcooked. Its",The Handmaids Tale,"Atwood, Margaret"
2511,"better than bloody, which is the other way she does it. Rita has ways of making her resentments felt. A baked potato, green beans, salad. Canned",The Handmaids Tale,"Atwood, Margaret"
2512,"pears for dessert. Its good enough food, though bland. Healthy food. You have to get your vitamins and minerals, said Aunt Lydia coyly. You must
be a worthy vessel. No coffee or tea though, no alcohol. Studies have been done. Theres a paper napkin, as in cafeterias.",The Handmaids Tale,"Atwood, Margaret"
2513,"I think of the others, those without. This is the heartland, here, Im leading a pampered life, may the Lord make us truly grateful, said Aunt Lydia,
or was it thankful, and I start to eat the food. Im not hungry tonight. I feel sick to my stomach. But theres no place to put the food, no potted plants,
and I wont chance the toilet. Im too nervous, thats what it is. Could I leave it on the plate, ask Cora not to report me? I chew and swallow, chew and",The Handmaids Tale,"Atwood, Margaret"
2514,"swallow, feeling the sweat come out. In my stomach the food balls itself together, a handful of damp cardboard, squeezed.",The Handmaids Tale,"Atwood, Margaret"
2515,"Downstairs, in the dining room, there will be candles on the large mahogany table, a white cloth, silver, flowers, wine glasses with wine in them.",The Handmaids Tale,"Atwood, Margaret"
2516,"There will be the click of knives against china, a clink as she sets down her fork, with a barely audible sigh, leaving half the contents of her plate",The Handmaids Tale,"Atwood, Margaret"
2517,"untouched. Possibly she will say she has no appetite. Possibly she wont say anything. If she says something, does he comment? If she doesnt say",The Handmaids Tale,"Atwood, Margaret"
2518,"anything, does he notice? I wonder how she manages to get herself noticed. I think it must be hard.",The Handmaids Tale,"Atwood, Margaret"
2519,"Theres a pat of butter on the side of the plate. I tear off a corner of the paper napkin, wrap the butter in it, take it to the cupboard and slip it into
the toe of my right shoe, from the extra pair, as I have done before. I crumple up the rest of the napkin: no one, surely, will bother to smooth it out, to
check if any is missing. I will use the butter later tonight. It would not do, this evening, to smell of butter.

I wait. I compose myself. My self is a thing I must now compose, as one composes a speech. What I must present is a made thing, not
something born.

Nap
CHAPTER 13
Theres time to spare. This is one of the things I wasnt prepared for î the amount of unfilled time, the long parentheses of nothing. Time as
white sound. If only I could embroider. Weave, knit, something to do with my hands. I want a cigarette. I remember walking in art galleries, through
the nineteenth century: the obsession they had then with harems. Dozens of paintings of harems, fat women lolling on divans, turbans on their heads
or velvet caps, being fanned with peacock tails, a eunuch in the background standing guard. Studies of sedentary flesh, painted by men whod",The Handmaids Tale,"Atwood, Margaret"
2520,"never been there. These pictures were supposed to be erotic, and I thought they were, at the time; but I see now what they were really about. They",The Handmaids Tale,"Atwood, Margaret"
2521,"were paintings about suspended animation; about waiting, about objects not in use. They were paintings about boredom. But maybe boredom is",The Handmaids Tale,"Atwood, Margaret"
2522,"erotic, when women do it, for men.",The Handmaids Tale,"Atwood, Margaret"
2523,"I wait, washed, brushed, fed, like a prize pig. Sometime in the eighties they invented pig balls, for pigs who were being fattened in pens. Pig",The Handmaids Tale,"Atwood, Margaret"
2524,balls were large colored balls; the pigs rolled them around with their snouts. The pig marketers said this improved their muscle tone; the pigs were,The Handmaids Tale,"Atwood, Margaret"
2525,"curious, they liked to have something to think about.",The Handmaids Tale,"Atwood, Margaret"
2526,"I read about that in introduction to Psychology; that, and the chapter on caged rats whod give themselves electric shocks for something to do.
And the one on the pigeons, trained to peck a button that made a grain of corn appear. Three groups of them: the first got one grain per peck, the
second one grain every other peck, the third was random. When the man in charge cut off the grain, the first group gave up quite soon, the second
group a little later. The third group never gave up. Theyd peck themselves to death, rather than quit. Who knew what worked?",The Handmaids Tale,"Atwood, Margaret"
2527,I wish I had a pig ball.,The Handmaids Tale,"Atwood, Margaret"
2528,"I lie down on the braided rug. You can always practice, said Aunt Lydia. Several sessions a day, fitted into your daily routine. Arms at the sides,",The Handmaids Tale,"Atwood, Margaret"
2529,"knees bent, lift the pelvis, roll the backbone down. Tuck. Again. Breathe in to the count of five, hold, expel. Wed do that in what used to be the
Domestic Science room, cleared now of sewing machines and washer-dryers; in unison, lying on little Japanese mats, a tape playing, Les
Sylphides. Thats what I hear now, in my head, as I lift, tilt, breathe. Behind my closed eyes thin white dancers flit gracefully among the trees, their",The Handmaids Tale,"Atwood, Margaret"
2530,legs fluttering like the wings of held birds.,The Handmaids Tale,"Atwood, Margaret"
2531,"In the afternoons we lay on our beds for an hour in the gymnasium, between three and four. They said it was a period of rest and meditation. I",The Handmaids Tale,"Atwood, Margaret"
2532,"thought then they did it because they wanted some time off themselves, from teaching us, and I know the Aunts not on duty went off to the teachers
room for a cup of coffee, or whatever they called by that name. But now I think that the rest also was practice. They were giving us a chance to get
used to blank time.
A catnap, Aunt Lydia called it, in her coy way.
The strange thing is we needed the rest. Many of us went to sleep. We were tired there, a lot of the time. We were on some kind of pill or drug I
think, they put it in the food, to keep us calm. But maybe not. Maybe it was the place itself. After the first shock, after youd come to terms, it was",The Handmaids Tale,"Atwood, Margaret"
2533,better to be lethargic. You could tell yourself you were saving up your strength.,The Handmaids Tale,"Atwood, Margaret"
2534,"I must have been there three weeks when Moira came. She was brought into the gymnasium by two of the Aunts, in the usual way, while we",The Handmaids Tale,"Atwood, Margaret"
2535,"were having our nap. She still had her other clothes on, jeans and a blue sweatshirt î her hair was short, shed defied fashion as usual î so I
recognized her at once. She saw me too, but she turned away, she already knew what was safe. There was a bruise on her left cheek, turning
purple. The Aunts took her to a vacant bed where the red dress was already laid out. She undressed, began to dress again, in silence, the Aunts
standing at the end of the bed, the rest of us watching from inside our slitted eyes. As she bent over I could see the knobs on her spine.
I couldnt talk to her for several days; we looked only, small glances, like sips. Friendships were suspicious, we knew it, we avoided each other",The Handmaids Tale,"Atwood, Margaret"
2536,"during the mealtime line-ups in the cafeteria and in the halls between classes. But on the fourth day she was beside me during the walk, two by two",The Handmaids Tale,"Atwood, Margaret"
2537,"around the football field. We werent given the white wings until we graduated, we had only the veils; so we could talk, as long as we did it quietly
and didnt turn to look at one another. The Aunts walked at the head of the line and at the end, so the only danger was from the others. Some were",The Handmaids Tale,"Atwood, Margaret"
2538,believers and might report us.,The Handmaids Tale,"Atwood, Margaret"
2539,"This is a loony bin, Moira said.",The Handmaids Tale,"Atwood, Margaret"
2540,"Im so glad to see you, I said.
Where can we talk? said Moira.
Washroom, I said. Watch the clock. End stall, two-thirty.
That was all we said.
It makes me feel safer, that Moira is here. We can go to the washroom if we put our hands up, though theres a limit to how many times a day,",The Handmaids Tale,"Atwood, Margaret"
2541,"they mark it down on a chart. I watch the clock, electric and round, at the front over the green blackboard. Two-thirty comes during Testifying. Aunt",The Handmaids Tale,"Atwood, Margaret"
2542,"Helena is here, as well as Aunt Lydia, because Testifying is special. Aunt Helena is fat, she once headed a Weight Watchers franchise operation
in Iowa, Shes good at Testifying.",The Handmaids Tale,"Atwood, Margaret"
2543,"Its Janine, telling about how she was gang-raped at fourteen and had an abortion. She told the same story last week. She seemed almost

2551,"Last week, Janine burst into tears. Aunt Helena made her kneel at the front of the classroom, hands behind her back, where we could all see",The Handmaids Tale,"Atwood, Margaret"
2552,"her, her red face and dripping nose. Her hair dull blond, her eyelashes so light they seemed not there, the lost eyelashes of someone whos been in
a fire. Burned eyes. She looked disgusting: weak, squirmy, blotchy, pink, like a newborn mouse. None of us wanted to look like that, ever. For a
moment, even though we knew what was being done to her, we despised her.
Crybaby. Crybaby. Crybaby.
We meant it, which is the bad part.
I used to think well of myself. I didnt then.",The Handmaids Tale,"Atwood, Margaret"
2553,"That was last week. This week Janine doesnt wait for us to jeer at her. It was my fault, she says. It was my own fault. I led them on. I deserved
the pain.
Very good, Janine, says Aunt Lydia. You are an example.
I have to wait until this is over before I put up my hand. Sometimes, if you ask at the wrong moment, they say no. If you really have to go that can
be crucial. Yesterday Dolores wet the floor. Two Aunts hauled her away, a hand under each armpit. She wasnt there for the afternoon walk, but at",The Handmaids Tale,"Atwood, Margaret"
2554,"night she was back in her usual bed. All night we could hear her moaning, off and on.",The Handmaids Tale,"Atwood, Margaret"
2555,"What did they do to her? We whispered, from bed to bed.",The Handmaids Tale,"Atwood, Margaret"
2556,"I dont know.
Not knowing makes it worse.
I raise my hand, Aunt Lydia nods. I stand up and walk out into the hall, as inconspicuously as possible. Outside the washroom Aunt Elizabeth is
standing guard. She nods, signaling that I can go in.
This washroom used to be for boys. The mirrors have been replaced here too by oblongs of dull gray metal, but the urinals are still there, on
one wall, white enamel with yellow stains. They look oddly like babies coffins. I marvel again at the nakedness of mens lives: the showers right out
in the open, the body exposed for inspection and comparison, the public display of privates. What is it for? What purposes of reassurance does it
serve? The flashing of a badge, look, everyone, all is in order, I belong here. Why dont women have to prove to one another that they are women?",The Handmaids Tale,"Atwood, Margaret"
2557,"Some form of unbuttoning, some split-crotch routine, just as casual. A doglike sniffing.",The Handmaids Tale,"Atwood, Margaret"
2558,"The high school is old, the stalls are wooden, some kind of chipboard. I go into the second one from the end, swing the door to. Of course there",The Handmaids Tale,"Atwood, Margaret"
2559,"are no longer any locks. In the wood theres a small hole, at the back, next to the wall, about waist height, souvenir of some previous vandalism or
legacy of an ancient voyeur. Everyone in the Center knows about this hole in the woodwork; everyone except the Aunts.
Im afraid I am too late, held up by Janines Testifying: maybe Moira has been here already, maybe shes had to go back. They dont give you
much time. I look carefully down, aslant under the stall wall, and there are two red shoes. But how can I tell who it is?
I put my mouth to the wooden hole. Moira? I whisper.
Is that you? she says.
Yes, I say. Relief goes through me.
God, do I need a cigarette, says Moira.
Me too, I say.
I feel ridiculously happy.

I sink down into my body as into a swamp, fenland, where only I know the footing. Treacherous ground, my own territory. I become the earth I
set my ear against, for rumors of the future. Each twinge, each murmur of slight pain, ripples of sloughed-off matter, swellings and diminishings of
tissue, the droolings of the flesh, these are signs, these are the things I need to know about, Each month I watch for blood, fearfully, for when it
comes it means failure. I have failed once again to fulfill the expectations of others, which may have become my own.
I used to think of my body as an instrument, of pleasure, or a means of transportation, or an implement for the accomplishment of my will. I
could use it to run, push buttons of one sort or another, make things happen. There were limits, but my body was nevertheless lithe, single, solid,
one with me.
Now the flesh arranges itself differently Im a cloud, congealed around a central object, the shape of a pear, which is hard and more real than I",The Handmaids Tale,"Atwood, Margaret"
2560,"am and glows red within its translucent wrapping. Inside it is a space, huge as the sky at night and dark and curved like that, though black-red rather",The Handmaids Tale,"Atwood, Margaret"

2564,"Im in our first apartment, in the bedroom. Im standing in front of the cupboard, which has folding doors made of wood. Around me I know its
empty, all the furniture is gone, the floors are bare, no carpets even; but despite this the cupboard is full of clothes. I think theyre my clothes, but they",The Handmaids Tale,"Atwood, Margaret"
2565,"dont look like mine, Ive never seen them before. Maybe theyre clothes belonging to Lukes wife, whom Ive also never seen; only pictures and a
voice on the phone, late at night, when she was calling us, before the divorce. But no, theyre my clothes all right. I need a dress, I need something to",The Handmaids Tale,"Atwood, Margaret"
2566,"wear. I pull out dresses, black, blue, purple, jackets, skirts; none of them will do, none of them even fits, theyre too big or too small.
Luke is there, behind me, I turn to see him. He wont look at me, he looks down at the floor, where the cat is rubbing itself against his legs,",The Handmaids Tale,"Atwood, Margaret"

2590,"steady herself, as if Im a piece of furniture. Shes done it before.",The Handmaids Tale,"Atwood, Margaret"
2591,"The sitting room would once have been called a drawing room, perhaps; then a living room. Or maybe its a parlor, the kind with a spider and
flies. But now its officially a sitting room, because thats what is done in it, by some. For others theres standing room only. The posture of the body",The Handmaids Tale,"Atwood, Margaret"
2592,"is important, here and now: minor discomforts are instructive.",The Handmaids Tale,"Atwood, Margaret"
2593,"The sitting room is subdued, symmetrical; its one of the shapes money takes when it freezes. Money has trickled through this room for years
and years, as if through an underground cavern, crusting and hardening like stalactites into these found, Mutely the varied, surfaces present
themselves: the dusk-rose velvet of the drawn drapes, the gloss of the matching chairs, eighteenth century, the cows-tongue hush of the tufted",The Handmaids Tale,"Atwood, Margaret"
2594,"Chinese rug on the floor, with its peach-pink peonies, the suave leather of the Commanders chair, the glint of brass on the box beside it.
The rug is authentic. Some things in this room are authentic, some are not. For instance, two paintings, both of women, one on either side of
the fireplace. Both wear dark dresses, like the ones in the old church, though of a later date. The paintings are possibly authentic. I suspect that
when Serena Joy acquired them, after it became obvious to her that shed have to redirect her energies into something convincingly domestic, she",The Handmaids Tale,"Atwood, Margaret"
2595,"had the intention of passing them off as ancestors. Or maybe they were in the house when the Commander bought it. Theres no way of knowing
such things. In any case, there they hang, their backs and mouths stiff, their breasts constricted, their faces pinched, their caps starched, their skin
grayish white, guarding the room with their narrowed eyes.
Between them, over the mantel, theres an oval mirror, flanked by two pairs of silver candlesticks, with a white china Cupid centered between",The Handmaids Tale,"Atwood, Margaret"
2596,"them, its arm around the neck of a lamb. The tastes of Serena Joy are a strange blend: hard lust for quality, soft sentimental cravings. Theres a
dried flower arrangement on either end of the mantelpiece, and a vase of real daffodils on the polished marquetry end table beside the sofa.
The room smells of lemon oil, heavy cloth, fading daffodils, the leftover smells of cooking that have made their way from the kitchen or the
dining room, and of Serena Joys perfume: Lily of the Valley. Perfume is a luxury, she must have some private source. I breathe it in, thinking I",The Handmaids Tale,"Atwood, Margaret"
2597,"should appreciate it. Its the scent of pre-pubescent girls, of the gifts young children used to give their mothers, for Mothers Day; the smell of white",The Handmaids Tale,"Atwood, Margaret"
2598,"cotton socks and white cotton petticoats, of dusting powder, of the innocence of female flesh not yet given over to hairiness and blood. It makes me",The Handmaids Tale,"Atwood, Margaret"
2599,"feel slightly ill, as if Im in a closed car on a hot muggy day with an older woman wearing too much face powder. This is what the sitting room is like,
despite its elegance.
I would like to steal something from this room. I would like to take some small thing, the scrolled ashtray, the little silver pillbox from the mantel
perhaps, or a dried flower: hide it in the folds of my dress or in my zippered sleeve, keep it there until this evening is over, secrete it in my room,
under the bed, or in a shoe, or in a slit in the hard petit point FAITH cushion. Every once in a while I would take it out and look at it. It would make me
feel that I have power.
But such a feeling would be an illusion, and too risky. My hands stay where they are, folded in my lap. Thighs together, heels tucked underneath
me, pressing up against my body. Head lowered. In my mouth theres the taste of toothpaste: fake mint and plaster.",The Handmaids Tale,"Atwood, Margaret"

2608,"Nick walks in, nods to all three of us, looks around the room. He too takes his place behind me, standing. Hes so close that the tip of his boot
is touching my foot. Is this on purpose? Whether it is or not we are touching, two shapes of leather. I feel my shoe soften, blood flows into it, it grows
warm, it becomes a skin. I move my foot slightly, away.
""Wish hed hurry up, says Cora.
Hurry up and wait, says Nick. He laughs, moves his foot so it's touching mine again. No one can see, beneath the folds of my outspread skirt.
I shift, it's too warm in here, the smell of stale perfume makes me feel a little sick. I move my foot away.
We hear Serena coming, down the stairs, along the hall, the muffled tap of her cane on the rug, thud of the good foot. She hobbles through the
doorway, glances at us, counting but not seeing. She nods, at Nick, but says nothing. She's in one of her best dresses, sky blue with embroidery in
white along the edges of the veil: flowers and fretwork. Even at her age she still feels the urge to wreathe herself in flowers. No use for you, I think at
her, my face unmoving, you cant use them anymore, you're withered. They're the genital organs of plants. I read that somewhere, once.
She makes her way to her chair and footstool, turns, lowers herself, lands ungracefully. She hoists her left foot onto the stool, fumbles in her
sleeve pocket. I can hear the rustling, the click of her lighter, I smell the hot singe of the smoke, breathe it in.
Late as usual, she says. We don't answer. There's a clatter as she gropes on the lamp table, then a click, and the television set runs through
its warm-up.
A male choir, with greenish-yellow skin, the color needs adjusting; they're singing Come to the Church in the Wildwood. Come, come, come,
come, sing the basses. Serena clicks the channel changer. Waves, colored zigzags, a garble of sound: it's the Montreal satellite station, being
blocked. Then there's a preacher, earnest, with shining dark eyes, leaning towards us across a desk. These days they look a lot like businessmen.
Serena gives him a few seconds, then clicks onward.
Several blank channels, then the news. This is what she's been looking for. She leans back, inhales deeply. I on the contrary lean forward, a
child being allowed up late with the grown-ups. This is the one good thing about these evenings, the evenings of the Ceremony: I'm allowed to watch
the news. It seems to be an unspoken rule in this household: we always get here on time, he's always late, Serena always lets us watch the news.

Such as it is: who knows if any of it is true? It could be old clips, it could be faked. But I watch it anyway, hoping to be able to read beneath it.
Any news, now, is better than none.
First, the front lines. They are not lines, really: the war seems to be going on in many places at once.
Wooded hills, seen from above, the trees a sickly yellow. I wish she'd fix the color. The Appalachian Highlands, says the voice-over, where the
Angels of the Apocalypse, Fourth Division, are smoking out a pocket of Baptist guerillas, with air support from the Twenty-first Battalion of the
Angels of Light. We are shown two helicopters, black ones with silver wings painted on the sides. Below them, a clump of trees explodes.
Now a close shot of a prisoner, with a stubbled and dirty face, flanked by two Angels in their neat black uniforms. The prisoner accepts a
cigarette from one of the Angels, puts it awkwardly to his lips with his bound hands. He gives a lopsided little grin. The announcer is saying
something, but I don't hear it: I look into this man's eyes, trying to decide what he's thinking. He knows the camera is on him: is the grin a show of
defiance, or is it submission? Is he embarrassed, at having been caught?
They only show us victories, never defeats. Who wants bad news?
Possibly he's an actor.
The anchorman comes on now. His manner is kindly, fatherly; he gazes out at us from the screen, looking, with his tan and his white hair and
candid eyes, wise wrinkles around them, like everybody's ideal grandfather. What he's telling us, his level smile implies, is for our own good.
Everything will be all right soon. I promise. There will be peace. You must trust. You must go to sleep, like good children.
He tells us what we long to believe. He's very convincing.
I struggle against him. He's like an old movie star, I tell myself, with false teeth and a face job. At the same time I sway towards him, like one
hypnotized. If only it were true. If only I could believe.
Now he's telling us that an underground espionage ring has been cracked by a team of Eyes, working with an inside informant. The ring has
been smuggling precious national resources over the border into Canada.
Five members of the heretical sect of Quakers have been arrested, he says, smiling blandly, and more arrests are anticipated.
Two of the Quakers appear onscreen, a man and a woman. They look terrified, but they're trying to preserve some dignity in front of the
camera. The man has a large dark mark on his forehead; the woman's veil has been torn off, and her hair falls in strands over her face. Both of them
are about fifty.
Now we can see a city, again from the air. This used to be Detroit. Under the voice of the announcer there's the thunk of artillery. From the
skyline columns of smoke ascend.
Resettlement of the Children of Ham is continuing on schedule, says the reassuring pink face, back on the screen. Three thousand have",The Handmaids Tale,"Atwood, Margaret"
2609,"arrived this week in National Homeland One, with another two thousand in transit. How are they transporting that many people at once? Trains,
buses? We are not shown any pictures of this. National Homeland One is in North Dakota. Lord knows what they're supposed to do, once they get
there. Farm, is the theory.
Serena Joy has had enough of the news. Impatiently she clicks the button for a station change, comes up with an aging bass baritone, his
cheeks like emptied udders. Whispering Hope is what he's singing. Serena turns him off.
We wait, the clock in the hall ticks, Serena lights another cigarette, I get into the car. It's a Saturday morning, it's a September, we still have a
car. Other people have had to sell theirs. My name isn't Offred, I have another name, which nobody uses now because it's forbidden. I tell myself it
doesn't matter, your name is like your telephone number, useful only to others; but what I tell myself is wrong, it does matter. I keep the knowledge of
this name like something hidden, some treasure I'll come back to dig up, one day. I think of this name as buried. This name has an aura around it,
like an amulet, some charm that's survived from an unimaginably distant past. I lie in my single bed at night, with my eyes closed, and the name
floats there behind my eyes, not quite within reach, shining in the dark.
It's a Saturday morning in September, I'm wearing my shining name. The little girl who is now dead sits in the back seat, with her two best dolls,
her stuffed rabbit, mangy with age and love. I know all the details. They are sentimental details but I can't help that. I can't think about the rabbit too
much though, I can't start to cry, here on the Chinese rug, breathing in the smoke that has been inside Serena's body. Not here, not now, I can do
that later.
She thought we were going on a picnic, and in fact there is a picnic basket on the back seat, beside her, with real food in it, hard-boiled eggs,
thermos and all. We didn't want her to know where we were really going, we didn't want her to tell, by mistake, reveal anything, if we were stopped.
We didn't want to lay upon her the burden of our truth.
I wore my hiking boots, she had on her sneakers. The laces of the sneakers had a design of hearts on them, red, purple, pink, and yellow. It
was warm for the time of year, the leaves were turning already, some of them; Luke drove, I sat beside him, the sun shone, the sky was blue, the
houses as we passed them looked comforting and ordinary, each house as it was left behind vanishing into past time, crumbling in an instant as if it
had never been, because I would never see it again, or so I thought then.
We have almost nothing with us, we don't want to look as if we're going anywhere far or permanent. We have the forged passports,
guaranteed, worth the price. We couldn't pay in money, of course, or put it on the Compucount: we used other things, some jewelry that was my
grandmother's, a stamp collection Luke inherited from his uncle. Such things can be exchanged, for money, in other countries. When we get to the
border we'll pretend we're just going over on a day trip; the fake visas are for a day. Before that I'll give her a sleeping pill so she'll be asleep when
we cross. That way she won't betray us. You can't expect a child to lie convincingly.
And I don't want her to feel frightened, to feel the fear that is now tightening my muscles, tensing my spine, pulling me so taut that I'm certain I
would break if touched. Every stoplight is an ordeal. We'll spend the night at a motel, or, better, sleeping in the car on a side road so there will be no
suspicious questions. We'll cross in the morning, drive over the bridge, easily, just like driving to the supermarket.
We turn onto the freeway, head north, flowing with not much traffic. Since the war started, gas is expensive and in short supply. Outside the city
we pass the first checkpoint. All they want is a look at the license, Luke does it well. The license matches the passport: we thought of that.
Back on the road, he squeezes my hand, glances over at me. You're white as a sheet, he says.
That is how I feel: white, flat, thin. I feel transparent. Surely they will be able to see through me. Worse, how will I be able to hold on to Luke, to
her, when I'm so flat, so white? I feel as if there's not much left of me; they will slip through my arms, as if I'm made of smoke, as if I'm a mirage,
fading before their eyes. Don't think that way, Moira would say. Think that way and you'll make it happen.
Cheer up, says Luke. He's driving a little too fast now. The adrenaline's gone to his head. Now he's singing. Oh what a beautiful morning, he
sings.
Even his singing worries me. We've been warned not to look too happy.

CHAPTER 15
The Commander knocks at the door. The knock is prescribed: the sitting room is supposed to be Serena Joy's territory, he's supposed to ask
permission to enter it. She likes to keep him waiting. It's a little thing, but in this household little things mean a lot. Tonight, however, she doesn't
even get that, because before Serena Joy can speak he steps forward into the room anyway. Maybe he's just forgotten the protocol, but maybe it's
deliberate. Who knows what she said to him, over the silver-encrusted dinner table? Or didn't say.
The Commander has on his black uniform, in which he looks like a museum guard. A semi-retired man, genial but wary, killing time. But only at
first glance. After that he looks like a mid-western bank president, with his straight neatly brushed silver hair, his sober posture, shoulders a little
stooped. And after that there is his mustache, silver also, and after that his chin, which really you can't miss. When you get down as far as the chin
he looks like a vodka ad, in a glossy magazine, of times gone by.
His manner is mild, his hands large, with thick fingers and acquisitive thumbs, his blue eyes uncommunicative, falsely innocuous. He looks us
over as if taking inventory. One kneeling woman in red, one seated woman in blue, two in green, standing, a solitary man, thin-faced, in the
background. He manages to appear puzzled, as if he can't quite remember how we all got in here. As if we are something he inherited, like a
Victorian pump organ, and he hasn't figured out what to do with us. What we are worth.
He nods in the general direction of Serena Joy, who does not make a sound. He crosses to the large leather chair reserved for him, takes the
key out of his pocket, fumbles with the ornate brass-bound leather-covered box that stands on the table beside the chair. He inserts the key, opens
the box, lifts out the Bible, an ordinary copy, with a black cover and gold-edged pages. The Bible is kept locked up, the way people once kept tea
locked up, so the servants wouldn't steal it. It is an incendiary device: who knows what we'd make of it, if we ever got our hands on it? We can be
read to from it, by him, but we cannot read. Our heads turn towards him, we are expectant, here comes our bedtime story.
The Commander sits down and crosses his legs, watched by us. The bookmarks are in place. He opens the book. He clears his throat a little,
as if embarrassed.
Could I have a drink of water? he says to the air. Please, he adds.
Behind me, one of them, Cora or Rita, leaves her space in the tableau and pads off towards the kitchen. The Commander sits, looking down.
The Commander sighs, takes out a pair of reading glasses from his inside jacket pocket, gold rims, slips them on. Now he looks like a shoemaker
in an old fairy-tale book. Is there no end to his disguises, of benevolence?
We watch him: every inch, every flicker.

To be a man, watched by women. It must be entirely strange. To have them watching him all the time. To have them wondering, What's he
going to do next? To have them flinch when he moves, even if it's a harmless enough move, to reach for an ashtray perhaps. To have them sizing
him up. To have them thinking, He can't do it, he won't do, he'll have to do, this last as if he were a garment, out of style or shoddy, which must
nevertheless be put on because there's nothing else available.
To have them putting him on, trying him on, trying him out, while he himself puts them on, like a sock over a foot, onto the stub of himself, his
extra, sensitive thumb, his tentacle, his delicate, stalked slug's eye, which extrudes, expands, winces, and shrivels back into himself when touched
wrongly, grows big again, bulging a little at the tip, traveling forward as if along a leaf, into them, avid for vision. To achieve vision in this way, this
journey into a darkness that is composed of women, a woman, who can see in darkness while he himself strains blindly forward.
She watches him from within. We're all watching him. It's the one thing we can really do, and it is not for nothing: if he were to falter, fail, or die,
what would become of us? No wonder he's like a boot, hard on the outside, giving shape to a pulp of tenderfoot. That's just a wish. I've been
watching him for some time and he's given no evidence, of softness.
But watch out, Commander, I tell him in my head. I've got my eye on you. One false move and I'm dead.
Still, it must be hell, to be a man, like that.
It must be just fine.
It must be hell.
It must be very silent.

The water appears, the Commander drinks it. Thank you, he says. Cora rustles back into place.
The Commander pauses, looking down, scanning the page. He takes his time, as if unconscious of us. He's like a man toying with a steak,
behind a restaurant window, pretending not to see the eyes watching him from hungry darkness not three feet from his elbow. We lean towards him
a little, iron filings to his magnet. He has something we don't have, he has the word. How we squandered it, once.
The Commander, as if reluctantly, begins to read. He isn't very good at it. Maybe he's merely bored.
It's the usual story, the usual stories. God to Adam, God to Noah. Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth. Then comes the moldy old
Rachel and Leah stuff we had drummed into us at the Center. Give me children, or else I die. Am I in God's stead, who hath withheld from thee the
fruit of the womb? Behold my maid Bilhah. She shall bear upon my knees, that I may also have children by her. And so on and so forth. We had
it read to us every breakfast, as we sat in the high school cafeteria, eating porridge with cream and brown sugar. You're getting the best, you know,
said Aunt Lydia. There's a war on, things are rationed. You are spoiled girls, she twinkled, as if rebuking a kitten. Naughty puss.
For lunch it was the Beatitudes. Blessed be this, blessed be that. They played it from a tape, so not even an Aunt would be guilty of the sin of
reading. The voice was a man's. Blessed be the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven. Blessed are the merciful. Blessed be the
meek. Blessed are the silent. I knew they made that up, I knew it was wrong, and they left things out, too, but there was no way of checking.
Blessed be those that mourn, for they shall be comforted.
Nobody said when.
I check the clock, during dessert, canned pears with cinnamon, standard for lunch, and look for Moira in her place, two tables over. She's gone
already. I put my hand up, I am excused. We don't do this too often, and always at different times of day.
In the washroom I go to the second-last stall, as usual.

Are you there? I whisper.
Large as life and twice as ugly, Moira whispers back.
What have you heard? I ask her.
Nothing much. I've got to get out of here, I'm going bats.
I feel panic. No, no, Moira, I say, don't try it. Not on your own.
I'll fake sick. They send an ambulance, I've seen it.
You'll only get as far as the hospital.
At least it'll be a change. I won't have to listen to that old bitch.
They'll find you out.
Not to worry, I'm good at it. When I was a kid in high school I cut out vitamin C, I got scurvy. In the early stages they can't diagnose it. Then you
just start it again and you're fine. I'll hide my vitamin pills.
Moira, don't.
I couldn't stand the thought of her not being here, with me. For me.
They send two guys with you, in the ambulance. Think about it. They must be starved for it, shit, they aren't even allowed to put their hands in
their pockets, the possibilities are‚Äî
You in there. Time's up, said the voice of Aunt Elizabeth, from the doorway. I stood up, flushed the toilet. Two of Moira's fingers appeared,
through the hole in the wall. It was only large enough for two fingers. I touched my own fingers to them, quickly, held on, Let go.

And Leah said, God hath given me my hire, because I have given my maiden to my husband, says the Commander. He lets the book fall
closed. It makes an exhausted sound, like a padded door shutting, by itself, at a distance: a puff of air. The sound suggests the softness of the thin
oniony pages, how they would feel under the fingers. Soft and dry, like papier poudre, pink and powdery, from the time before, you'd get it in
booklets for taking the shine off your nose, in those stores that sold candles and soap in the shapes of things: seashells, mushrooms. Like cigarette
paper. Like petals.
The Commander sits with his eyes closed for a moment, as if tired. He works long hours. He has a lot of responsibilities.
Serena has begun to cry. I can hear her, behind my back. It isn't the first time. She always does this, the night of the Ceremony. She's trying not
to make a noise. She's trying to preserve her dignity, in front of us. The upholstery and the rugs muffle her but we can hear her clearly despite that.
The tension between her lack of control and her attempt to suppress it is horrible. It's like a fart in church. I feel, as always, the urge to laugh, but not
because I think it's funny. The smell of her crying spreads over us and we pretend to ignore it.
The Commander opens his eyes, notices, frowns, ceases to notice. Now we will have a moment of silent prayer, says the Commander. We",The Handmaids Tale,"Atwood, Margaret"
2610,"will ask for a blessing, and for success in all our ventures.
I bow my head and close my eyes. I listen to the held breath, the almost inaudible gasps, the shaking going on behind my back. How she must
hate me, I think.

I pray silently: Nolite te bastardes carborundorum. I don't know what it means, but it sounds right, and it will have to do, because I don't know
what else I can say to God. Not right now. Not, as they used to say, at this juncture. The scratched writing on my cupboard wall floats before me, left
by an unknown woman, with the face of Moira. I saw her go out, to the ambulance, on a stretcher, carried by two Angels.
What is it? I mouthed to the woman beside me; safe enough, a question like that, to all but a fanatic.
A fever, she formed with her lips. Appendicitis, they say.
I was having dinner, that evening, hamburger balls and hashed browns. My table was near the window, I could see out, as far as the front gates.
I saw the ambulance come back, no siren this time. One of the Angels jumped out, talked with the guard. The guard went into the building; the
ambulance stayed parked; the Angel stood with his back towards us, as they had been taught to do. Two of the Aunts came out of the building, with
the guard. They went around to the back. They hauled Moira out, dragged her in through the gate and up the front steps, holding her under the
armpits, one on each side. She was having trouble walking. I stopped eating, I couldn't eat; by this time all of us on my side of the table were staring
out the window. The window was greenish, with that chicken wire mesh they used to put inside glass. Aunt Lydia said, Eat your dinner. She went
over and pulled down the blind.
They took her into the room that used to be the Science Lab. It was a room where none of us ever went willingly. Afterwards she could not walk
for a week, her feet would not fit into her shoes, they were too swollen. It was the feet they'd do, for a first offense. They used steel cables, frayed at
the ends. After that the hands. They didn't care what they did to your feet or your hands, even if it was permanent. Remember, said Aunt Lydia. For
our purposes your feet and your hands are not essential.
Moira lay on her bed, an example. She shouldn't have tried it, not with the Angels, Alma said, from the next bed over. We had to carry her to
classes. We stole extra paper packets of sugar for her, from the cafeteria at mealtimes, smuggled them to her, at night, handing them from bed to
bed. Probably she didn't need the sugar but it was the only thing we could find to steal. To give.
I am still praying but what I am seeing is Moira's feet the way they looked after they'd brought her back, Her feet did not look like feet at all. They
looked like drowned feet, swollen and boneless, except for the color. They looked like lungs.
Oh God, I pray. Nolite te bastardes carborundorum. Is this what you had in mind?
The Commander clears his throat. This is what he does to let us know that in his opinion it's time we stopped praying. For the eyes of the Lord",The Handmaids Tale,"Atwood, Margaret"
2611,"run to and fro throughout the whole earth, to know himself strong in the behalf of them whose heart is perfect towards him, he says.
It's the sign-off. He stands up. We are dismissed.

CHAPTER 16
The Ceremony goes as usual.
I lie on my back, fully clothed except for the healthy white cotton underdrawers. What I could see, if I were to open my eyes, would be the large

white canopy of Serena Joy's outsized colonial-style four-poster bed, suspended like a sagging cloud above us, a cloud sprigged with tiny drops of
silver rain, which, if you looked at them closely, would turn out to be four-petaled flowers. I would not see the carpet, which is white, or the sprigged
curtains and skirted dressing table with its silver-backed brush and mirror set; only the canopy, which manages to suggest at one and the same
time, by the gauziness of its fabric and its heavy downward curve, both ethereality and matter.
Or the sail of a ship. Big-bellied sails, they used to say, in poems. Bellying. Propelled forward by a swollen belly.
A mist of Lily of the Valley surrounds us, chilly, crisp almost. It's not warm in this room.
Above me, towards the head of the bed, Serena Joy is arranged, outspread. Her legs are apart, I lie between them, my head on her stomach,
her pubic bone under the base of my skull, her thigh on either side of me. She too is fully clothed,
My arms are raised; she holds my hands, each of mine in each of hers. This is supposed to signify that we are one flesh, one being. What it
really means is that she is in control, of the process and thus of the product. If any. The rings of her left hand cut into my fingers. It may or may not be
revenge.
My red skirt is hitched up to my waist, though no higher. Below it the Commander is fucking. What he is fucking is the lower part of my body. I
do not say making love, because this is not what he's doing. Copulating too would be inaccurate, because it would imply two people and only one is
involved. Nor does rape cover it: nothing is going on here that I haven't signed up for. There wasn't a lot of choice but there was some, and this is
what I chose.
Therefore I lie still and picture the unseen canopy over my head. I remember Queen Victoria's advice to her daughter: Close your eyes and
think of England. But this is not England. I wish he would hurry up.
Maybe I'm crazy and this is some new kind of therapy.
I wish it were true; then I could get better and this would go away.
Serena Joy grips my hands as if it is she, not I, who's being fucked, as if she finds it either pleasurable or painful, and the Commander fucks,
with a regular two-four marching stroke, on and on like a tap dripping. He is preoccupied, like a man humming to himself in the shower without
knowing he's humming; like a man who has other things on his mind. It's as if he's somewhere else, waiting for himself to come, drumming his
fingers on the table while he waits. There's an impatience in his rhythm now. But isn't this everyone's wet dream, two women at once? They used to
say that. Exciting, they used to say.
What's going on in this room, under Serena Joy's silvery canopy, is not exciting. It has nothing to do with passion or love or romance or any of
those other notions we used to titillate ourselves with. It has nothing to do with sexual desire, at least for me, and certainly not for Serena. Arousal
and orgasm are no longer thought necessary; they would be a symptom of frivolity merely, like jazz garters or beauty spots: superfluous distractions
for the light-minded. Outdated. It seems odd that women once spent such time and energy reading about such things, thinking about them, worrying
about them, writing about them. They are so obviously recreational.
This is not recreation, even for the Commander. This is serious business. The Commander, too, is doing his duty.
If I were going to open my eyes a slit, I would be able to see him, his not-unpleasant face hanging over my torso, with a few strands of his silver
hair falling perhaps over his forehead, intent on his inner journey, that place he is hurrying towards, which recedes as in a dream at the same speed
with which he approaches it. I would see his open eyes.
If he were better looking would I enjoy this more?
At least he's an improvement on the previous one, who smelled like a church cloakroom in the rain; like your mouth when the dentist starts
picking at your teeth; like a nostril. The Commander, instead, smells of mothballs, or is this odor some punitive form of aftershave? Why does he
have to wear that stupid uniform? But would I like his white, tufted raw body any better?
Kissing is forbidden between us. This makes it bearable.
One detaches oneself. One describes.
He comes at last, with a stifled groan as of relief. Serena Joy, who has been holding her breath, expels it. The Commander, who has been
propping himself on his elbows, away from our combined bodies, doesn't permit himself to sink down into us. He rests a moment, withdraws,
recedes, rezippers. He nods, then turns and leaves the room, closing the door with exaggerated care behind him, as if both of us are his ailing
mother. There's something hilarious about this, but I don't dare laugh.
Serena Joy lets go of my hands. You can get up now, she says. Get up and get out. She's supposed to have me rest, for ten minutes, with
my feet on a pillow to improve the chances. This is meant to be a time of silent meditation for her, but she's not in the mood for that. There is
loathing in her voice, as if the touch of my flesh sickens and contaminates her. I untangle myself from her body, stand up; the juice of the
Commander runs down my legs. Before I turn away I see her straighten her blue skirt, clench her legs together; she continues lying on the bed,
gazing up at the canopy above her, stiff and straight as an effigy.
Which of us is it worse for, her or me?

CHAPTER 17
This is what I do when I'm back in my room:
I take off my clothes and put on my nightgown.
I look for the pat of butter, in the toe of my right shoe, where I hid it after dinner. The cupboard was too warm, the butter is semi-liquid. Much of it
has sunk into the paper napkin I wrapped it in. Now I'll have butter in my shoe. Not the first time, because whenever there is butter or even
margarine, I save some in this way. I can get most of the butter off the shoe lining, with a washcloth or some toilet paper from the bathroom,
tomorrow.
I rub the butter over my face, work it into the skin of my hands. There's no longer any hand lotion or face cream, not for us. Such things are
considered vanities. We are containers, it's only the insides of our bodies that are important. The outside can become hard and wrinkled, for all
they care, like the shell of a nut. This was a decree of the Wives, this absence of hand lotion. They don't want us to look attractive. For them, things
are bad enough as it is.
The butter is a trick I learned at the Rachel and Leah Center. The Red Center, we called it, because there was so much red. My predecessor in
this room, my friend with the freckles and the good laugh, must have done this too, this buttering. We all do it.
As long as we do this, butter our skin to keep it soft, we can believe that we will some day get out, that we will be touched again, in love or
desire. We have ceremonies of our own, private ones.
The butter is greasy and it will go rancid and I will smell like an old cheese; but at least it's organic, as they used to say.

To such devices have we descended.
Buttered, I lie on my single bed, flat, like a piece of toast. I can't sleep. In the semidark I stare up at the blind plaster eye in the middle of the
ceiling, which stares back down at me, even though it can't see. There's no breeze, my white curtains are like gauze bandages, hanging limp,
glimmering in the aura cast by the searchlight that illuminates this house at night, or is there a moon?
I fold back the sheet, get carefully up, on silent bare feet, in my nightgown, go to the window, like a child, I want to see. The moon on the breast
of the new-fallen snow. The sky is clear but hard to make out, because of the searchlight; but yes, in the obscured sky a moon does float, newly, a
wishing moon, a sliver of ancient rock, a goddess, a wink. The moon is a stone and the sky is full of deadly hardware, but oh God, how beautiful
anyway.
I want Luke here so badly. I want to be held and told my name. I want to be valued, in ways that I am not; I want to be more than valuable. I
repeat my former name, remind myself of what I once could do, how others saw me.
I want to steal something.

In the hall the night-light's on, the long space glows gently pink; I walk, one foot set carefully down, then the other, without creaking, along the
runner, as if on a forest floor, sneaking, my heart quick, through the night house. I am out of place. This is entirely illegal.
Down past the fisheye on the hall wall, I can see my white shape, of tented body, hair down my back like a mane, my eyes gleaming. I like this. I
am doing something, on my own. The active, is it a tense? Tensed. What I would like to steal is a knife, from the kitchen, but I'm not ready for that.
I reach the sitting room, door's ajar, slip in, leave the door a little open. A squeak of wood, but who's near enough to hear? I stand in the room,
letting the pupils of my eyes dilate, like a cat's or owl's.
Old perfume, cloth dust fill my nostrils. There's a slight mist of light, coming through the cracks around the closed drapes, from the searchlight
outside, where two men doubtless patrol, I've seen them, from above, from behind my curtains, dark shapes, cutouts.
Now I can see outlines, gleams: from the mirror, the bases of the lamps, the vases, the sofa looming like a cloud at dusk.
What should I take? Something that will not be missed. In the wood at midnight, a magic flower. A withered daffodil, not one from the dried
arrangement. The daffodils will soon be thrown out, they're beginning to smell. Along with Serena's stale fumes, the stench of her knitting.
I grope, find an end table, feel. There's a clink, I must have knocked something. I find the daffodils, crisp at the edges where they've dried, limp
towards the stems, use my fingers to pinch. I will press this, somewhere. Under the mattress. Leave it there, for the next woman, the one who comes
after me, to find. But there's someone in the room, behind me. I hear the step, quiet as mine, the creaking of the same floorboard. The door closes
behind me, with a little click, cutting the light. I freeze: white was a mistake. I'm snow in moonlight, even in the dark.
Then a whisper: Dont scream. Its all right. As if I'd scream, as if it's all right. I turn: a shape, that's all, dull glint of cheekbone, devoid of color.
He steps towards me. Nick. What are you doing in here?
I don't answer. He too is illegal, here, with me, he can't give me away. Nor I him; for the moment we're mirrors. He puts his hand on my arm,
pulls me against him, his mouth on mine, what else comes from such denial? Without a word. Both of us shaking, how I'd like to. In Serena's parlor,
with the dried flowers, on the Chinese carpet, his thin body. A man entirely unknown. It would be like shouting, it would be like shooting someone.
My hand goes down, how about that, I could unbutton, and then. But it's too dangerous, he knows it, we push each other away, not far. Too much
trust, too much risk, too much already.
I was coming to find you, he says, breathes, almost into my ear. I want to reach up, taste his skin, he makes me hungry. His fingers move,
feeling my arm under the nightgown sleeve, as if his hand won't listen to reason. It's so good, to be touched by someone, to be felt so greedily, to
feel so greedy. Luke, you'd know, you'd understand. It's you here, in another body.
Bullshit.
Why? I say. Is it so bad, for him, that he'd take the risk of coming to my room at night? I think of the hanged men, hooked on the Wall. I can
hardly stand up. I have to get away, back to the stairs, before I dissolve entirely. His hand's on my shoulder now, held still, heavy, pressing down on
me like warm lead. Is this what I would die for? I'm a coward, I hate the thought of pain.
He told me to, Nick says. He wants to see you. In his office.
What do you mean? I say. The Commander, it must be. See me? What does he mean by see? Hasn't he had enough of me?
Tomorrow, he says, just audible. In the dark parlor we move away from each other, slowly, as if pulled towards each other by a force, current,
pulled apart also by hands equally strong.
I find the door, turn the knob, fingers on cool porcelain, open. It's all I can do.

Night
CHAPTER 18
I lie in bed, still trembling. You can wet the rim of a glass and run your finger around the rim and it will make a sound. This is what I feel like: this
sound of glass. I feel like the word shatter. I want to be with someone.

Lying in bed, with Luke, his hand on my rounded belly. The three of us, in bed, she kicking, turning over within me. Thunderstorm outside the
window, that's why she's awake, they can hear, they sleep, they can be startled, even there in the soothing of the heart, like waves on the shore
around them. A flash of lightning, quite close, Luke's eyes go white for an instant.
I'm not frightened. We're wide awake, the rain hits now, we will be slow and careful.
If I thought this would never happen again I would die.
But this is wrong, nobody dies from lack of sex, It's lack of love we die from. There's nobody here I can love, all the people I could love are dead
or elsewhere. Who knows where they are or what their names are now? They might as well be nowhere, as I am for them. I too am a missing
person.
From time to time I can see their faces, against the dark, flickering like the images of saints, in old foreign cathedrals, In the light of the drafty
candles; candles you would light to pray by, kneeling, your forehead against the wooden railing, hoping for an answer. I can conjure them but they
are mirages only, they don't last. Can I be blamed for wanting a real body, to put my arms around? Without it I too am disembodied. I can listen to
my own heartbeat against the bedsprings, I can stroke myself, under the dry white sheets, in the dark, but I too am dry and white, hard, granular; it's
like running my hand over a plateful of dried rice; it's like snow. There's something dead about it, something deserted. I am like a room where things
once happened and now nothing does, except the pollen of the weeds that grow up outside the window, blowing in as dust across the floor.

Here is what I believe.
I believe Luke is lying face down in a thicket, a tangle of bracken, the brown fronds from last year under the green ones just unrolled, or ground
hemlock perhaps, although it's too early for the red berries. What is left of him: his hair, the bones, the plaid wool shirt, green and black, the leather
belt, the work boots. I know exactly what he was wearing. I can see his clothes in my mind, bright as a lithograph or a full-color advertisement, from
an ancient magazine, though not his face, not so well. His face is beginning to fade, possibly because it wasn't always the same: his face had
different expressions, his clothes did not.
I pray that the hole, or two or three, there was more than one shot, they were close together, I pray that at least one hole is neatly, quickly, and
finally through the skull, through the place where all the pictures were, so that there would have been only the one flash, of darkness or pain, dull I
hope, like the word thud, only the one and then silence.
I believe this.
I also believe that Luke is sitting up, in a rectangle somewhere, gray cement, on a ledge or the edge of something, a bed or chair. God knows
what he's wearing, God knows what they've put him in. God isn't the only one who knows, so maybe there could be some way of finding out. He
hasn't shaved for a year, though they cut his hair short, whenever they feel like it, for lice they say. I'll have to revise that: if they cut the hair for lice,
they'd cut the beard too. You'd think.
Anyway, they don't do it well, the hair is ragged, the back of his neck is nicked, that's hardly the worst, he looks ten years older, twenty, he's
bent like an old man, his eyes are pouched, small purple veins have burst in his cheeks, there's a scar, no, a wound, it isn't yet healed, the color of
tulips, near the stem end, down the left side of his face where the flesh split recently. The body is so easily damaged, so easily disposed of, water
and chemicals is all it is, hardly more to it than a jellyfish, drying on sand.
He finds it painful to move his hands, painful to move. He doesn't know what he's accused of. A problem. There must be something, some
accusation. Otherwise why are they keeping him, why isn't he already dead? He must know something they want to know. I can't imagine. I can't
imagine he hasn't already said whatever it is. I would.
He is surrounded by a smell, his own, the smell of a cooped-up animal in a dirty cage. I imagine him resting, because I can't bear to imagine
him at any other time, just as I can't imagine anything below his collar, above his cuffs. I don't want to think what they've done to his body. Does he
have shoes? No, and the floor is cold and wet. Does he know I'm here, alive, that I'm thinking about him? I have to believe so. In reduced
circumstances you have to believe all kinds of things. I believe in thought transference now, vibrations in the ether, that sort of junk. I never used to.
I also believe that they didn't catch him or catch up with him after all, that he made it, reached the bank, swam the river, crossed the border,
dragged himself up on the far shore, an island, teeth chattering; found his way to a nearby farmhouse, was allowed in, with suspicion at first, but
then when they understood who he was, they were friendly, not the sort who would turn him in, perhaps they were Quakers, they will smuggle him
inland, from house to house, the woman made him some hot coffee and gave him a set of her husband's clothes. I picture the clothes. It comforts
me to dress him warmly.
He made contact with the others, there must be a resistance, a government in exile. Someone must be out there, taking care of things. I
believe in the resistance as I believe there can be no light without shadow; or rather, no shadow unless there is also light. There must be a
resistance, or where do all the criminals come from, on the television?
Any day now there may be a message from him. It will come in the most unexpected way, from the least likely person, someone I never would
have suspected. Under my plate, on the dinner tray? Slipped into my hand as I reach the tokens across the counter in All Flesh?
The message will say that I must have patience: sooner or later he will get me out, we will find her, wherever they've put her. She'll remember us
and we will be all three of us together. Meanwhile I must endure, keep myself safe for later. What has happened to me, what's happening to me
now, won't make any difference to him, he loves me anyway, he knows it isn't my fault. The message will say that also. It's this message, which may
never arrive, that keeps me alive. I believe in the message.
The things I believe can't all be true, though one of them must be. But I believe in all of them, all three versions of Luke, at one and the same

time. This contradictory way of believing seems to me, right now, the only way I can believe anything. Whatever the truth is, I will be ready for it.
This also is a belief of mine. This also may be untrue.
One of the gravestones in the cemetery near the earliest church has an anchor on it and an hourglass, and the words In Hope.
In Hope. Why did they put that above a dead person? Was it the corpse hoping, or those still alive?
Does Luke hope?

Birth Day
CHAPTER 19
I'm dreaming that I am awake.
I dream that I get out of bed and walk across the room, not this room, and go out the door, not this door. I'm at home, one of my homes, and
she's running to meet me, in her small green nightgown with the sunflower on the front, her feet bare, and I pick her up and feel her arms and legs go
around me and I begin to cry, because I know then that I'm not awake. I'm back in this bed, trying to wake up, and I wake up and sit on the edge of
the bed, and my mother comes in with a tray and asks me if I'm feeling better. When I was sick, as a child, she had to stay home from work, But I'm
not awake this time either.
After these dreams I do awake, and I know I'm really awake because there is the wreath, on the ceiling, and my curtains hanging like drowned
white hair. I feel drugged. I consider this: maybe they're drugging me. Maybe the life I think I'm living is a paranoid delusion.
Not a hope. I know where I am, and who, and what day it is. These are the tests, and I am sane. Sanity is a valuable possession I hoard it the
way people once hoarded money. I save it, so I will have enough, when the time comes.

Grayness comes through the curtains, hazy bright, not much sun today. I get out of bed, go to the window, kneel on the window seat, the hard
little cushion, FAITH, and look out. There is nothing to be seen.
I wonder what has become of the other two cushions. There must have been three, once. HOPE and CHARITY where have they been stowed?
Serena Joy has tidy habits. She wouldn't throw away anything not quite worn out. One for Rita, one for Cora?
The bell goes, I'm up before it, ahead of time, I dress, not looking down.

I sit in the chair and think about the word chair. It can also mean the leader of a meeting. It can also mean a mode of execution. It is the first
syllable in charity. It is the French word for flesh. None of these facts has any connection with the others.
These are the kinds of litanies I use, to compose myself.
In front of me is a tray, and on the tray are a glass of apple juice, a vitamin pill, a spoon, a plate with three slice of brown toast on it, a small dish
containing honey, and another plate with an eggcup on it, the kind that looks like a woman's torso, in a skirt. Under the skirt is the second egg,
being kept warm. The eggcup is white china with a blue stripe.
The first egg is white. I move the eggcup a little, so it's now in the watery sunlight that comes through the window and falls, brightening, waning,
brightening again, on the tray. The shell of the egg is smooth but also grained; small pebbles of calcium are defined by the sunlight, like craters on
the moon. It's a barren landscape, yet perfect; it's the sort of desert the saints went into, so their minds would not be distracted by profusion. I think
that this is what God must look like: an egg. The life of the moon may not be on the surface, but inside.
The egg is glowing now, as if it had an energy of its own. To look at the egg gives me intense pleasure.
The sun goes and the egg fades.
I pick the egg out of the cup and finger it for a moment. It's warm. Women used to carry such eggs between their breasts, to incubate them.
That would have felt good.
The minimalist life. Pleasure is an egg. Blessings that can be counted, on the fingers of one hand. But possibly this is how I am expected to
react. If I have an egg, what more can I want?
In reduced circumstances the desire to live attaches itself to strange objects. I would like a pet: a bird, say, or a cat. A familiar. Anything at all
familiar. A rat would do, in a pinch, but there's no chance of that. This house is too clean.
I slice the top off the egg with the spoon, and eat the contents.

While I'm eating the second egg, I hear the siren, at a great distance at first, winding its way towards me among the large houses and clipped
lawns, a thin sound like the hum of an insect; then nearing, opening out, like a flower of sound opening, into a trumpet. A proclamation, this siren. I
put down my spoon, my heart speeds up, I go to the window again: will it be blue and not for me? But I see it turn the corner, come along the street,
stop in front of the house, still blaring, and it's red. Joy to the world, rare enough these days. I leave the second egg half eaten, hurry to the closet for
my cloak, and already I can hear feet on the stairs and the voices calling.
Hurry, says Cora, wont wait all day."" and she helps me on with the cloak, shes actually smiling.",The Handmaids Tale,"Atwood, Margaret"
2612,"I almost run down the hall, the stairs are like skiing, the front door is wide, today I can go through it, and the Guardian stands there, saluting. Its
started to rain, a drizzle, and the gravid smell of earth and grass fills the air.
The red Birthmobile is parked in the driveway. Its back door is open and I clamber in. The carpet on the floor is red, red curtains are drawn
over the windows. There are three women in here already, sitting on the benches that run the length of the van on either side. The Guardian closes
and locks the double doors and climbs into the front, beside the driver; through the glassed-over wire grille we can see the backs of their heads.
We start with a lurch, while overhead the siren screams: Make way, make way!
""Who is it?"" I say to the woman next to me; into her ear, or where her ear must be under the white headdress, I almost have to shout, the noise
is so loud.
""Ofwarren,"" she shouts back. Impulsively she grabs my hand, squeezes it, as we lurch around the corner; she turns to me and I see her face,
there are tears running down her cheeks, but tears of what? Envy, disappointment? But no, shes laughing, she throws her arms around me, Ive
never seen her before, she hugs me, she has large breasts, under the red habit, she wipes her sleeve across her face. On this day we can do
anything we want.
I revise that: within limits.

Across from us on the other bench, one woman is praying, eyes closed, hands up to her mouth. Or she may not be praying. She may be biting
her thumbnails. Possibly shes trying to keep calm. The third woman is calm already, she sits with her arms folded, Smiling a little. The siren goes",The Handmaids Tale,"Atwood, Margaret"

Its a risk youre taking, said Aunt Lydia, but you are the shock troops, you will march out in advance, into dangerous territory. The greater the
risk the greater the glory. She clasped her hands, radiant with our phony courage. We looked down at the tops of our desks. To go through all that

2623,"Sometimes writers write about a world that does not yet exist. We do it for a hundred reasons. (Because its good to look forward, not back. Because we need to illuminate a path we hope or we fear humanity will take. Because the world of the future seems more enticing or more interesting than the world of today. Because we need to warn you. To encourage. To examine. To imagine.) The reasons for writing about the day after tomorrow, and all the tomorrows that follow it, are as many and as varied as the people writing.",Fahrenheit 451,"Bradbury, Ray"

2630,If only . . .ù lets us explore the glories and dangers of tomorrow. (If only dogs could talk. If only I were invisible.),Fahrenheit 451,"Bradbury, Ray"
2631,"If this goes on . . .ù is the most predictive of the three, although it doesnt try to predict an actual future with all its messy confusion. Instead, If this goes on . . .ù fiction takes an element of life today, something clear and obvious and normally something troubling, and asks what would happen if that thing, that one thing, became bigger, became all-pervasive, changed the way we thought and behaved. (If this goes on, all communication everywhere will be through text messages or computers, and direct speech between two people, without a machine, will be outlawed.)",Fahrenheit 451,"Bradbury, Ray"
2632,"Its a cautionary question, and it lets us explore cautionary worlds.",Fahrenheit 451,"Bradbury, Ray"
2633,"People thinkîwronglyîthat speculative fiction is about predicting the future, but it isnt; or if it is, it tends to do a rotten job of it. Futures are huge things that come with many elements and a billion variables, and the human race has a habit of listening to predictions for what the future will bring and then doing something quite different.",Fahrenheit 451,"Bradbury, Ray"
2634,"What speculative fiction is really good at is not the future but the presentîtaking an aspect of it that troubles or is dangerous, and extending and extrapolating that aspect into something that allows the people of that time to see what they are doing from a different angle and from a different place. Its cautionary.",Fahrenheit 451,"Bradbury, Ray"
2635,"Fahrenheit 451 is speculative fiction. Its an If this goes on . . .ù story. Ray Bradbury was writing about his present, which is our past.

2636,Listen.,Fahrenheit 451,"Bradbury, Ray"
2637,"If someone tells you what a story is about, they are probably right.",Fahrenheit 451,"Bradbury, Ray"
2638,"If they tell you that that is all the story is about, they are very definitely wrong.",Fahrenheit 451,"Bradbury, Ray"
2639,Any story is about a host of things. It is about the author; it is about the world the author sees and deals with and lives in; it is about the words chosen and the way those words are deployed; it is about the story itself and what happens in the story; it is about the people in the story; it is polemic; it is opinion.,Fahrenheit 451,"Bradbury, Ray"
2640,"An authors opinions of what a story is about are always valid and are always true: the author was there, after all, when the book was written. She came up with each word and knows why she used that word instead of another. But an author is a creature of her time, and even she cannot see everything that her book is about.",Fahrenheit 451,"Bradbury, Ray"
2641,"More than half a century has passed since 1953. In America in 1953, the comparatively recent medium of radio was already severely on the waneîits reign had lasted about thirty years, but now the exciting new medium of television had come into ascendancy, and the dramas and comedies of radio were either ending for good or reinventing themselves with a visual track on the idiot box.ù",Fahrenheit 451,"Bradbury, Ray"
2642,"The news channels in America warned of juvenile delinquentsîteenagers in cars who drove dangerously and lived for kicks. The Cold War was going onîa war between Russia and its allies and America and its allies in which nobody dropped bombs or fired bullets because a dropped bomb could tip the world into a Third World War, a nuclear war from which it would never return. The senate was holding hearings to root out hidden Communists and taking steps to stamp out comic books. And whole families were gathering around the television in the evenings.",Fahrenheit 451,"Bradbury, Ray"
2643,The joke in the 1950s went that in the old days you could tell who was home by seeing if the lights were on; now you knew who was home by seeing who had their lights off. The televisions were small and the pictures were in black and white and you needed to turn off the light to get a good picture.,Fahrenheit 451,"Bradbury, Ray"
2644,"If this goes on . . .ù thought Ray Bradbury, nobody will read books anymore,ù and Fahrenheit 451 began. He had written a short story once called The Pedestrian,ù about a man who is incarcerated by the police after he is stopped simply for walking. That story became part of the world he was building, and seventeen-year-old Clarisse McLellan becomes a pedestrian in a world where nobody walks.",Fahrenheit 451,"Bradbury, Ray"
2645,"What if . . . firemen burned down houses instead of saving them?ù Bradbury thought, and now he had his way in to the story. He had a fireman named Guy Montag, who saved a book from the flames instead of burning it.",Fahrenheit 451,"Bradbury, Ray"

2649,And then his story was done.,Fahrenheit 451,"Bradbury, Ray"

2651,"The book was published and acclaimed. People loved the book, and they argued about it. It was a novel about censorship, they said, about mind control, about humanity. About government control of our lives. About books.",Fahrenheit 451,"Bradbury, Ray"
2652,"It was filmed by Francois Truffaut, although the films ending seems darker than Bradburys, as if the remembering of books is perhaps not the safety net that Bradbury imagines, but is in itself another dead end.",Fahrenheit 451,"Bradbury, Ray"
2653,"I read Fahrenheit 451 as a boy: I did not understand Guy Montag, did not understand why he did what he did, but I understood the love of books that drove him. Books were the most important things in my life. The huge wall-screen televisions were as futuristic and implausible as the idea that people on the television would talk to me, that I could take part if I had a script. Fahrenheit was never a favorite book: it was too dark, too bleak for that. But when I read a story called Usher IIù in The Silver Locusts (the UK title for The Martian Chronicles), I recognized the world of outlawed authors and imagination with a fierce sort of familiar joy.",Fahrenheit 451,"Bradbury, Ray"
2654,"When I reread it as a teenager, Fahrenheit 451 had become a book about independence, about thinking for yourself. It was about treasuring books and the dissent inside the covers of books. It was about how we as humans begin by burning books and end by burning people.",Fahrenheit 451,"Bradbury, Ray"
2655,"Rereading it as an adult, I find myself marveling at the book once more. It is all of those things, yes, but it is also a period piece. The four-wall television being described is the television of the 1950s: variety shows with symphony orchestras and low-brow comedians, and soap operas. The world of fast-driving, crazy teenagers out for kicks, of an endless cold war that sometimes goes hot, of wives who appear to have no jobs or identities save for their husbands, of bad men being chased by hounds (even mechanical hounds) is a world that feels like it has its roots firmly in the 1950s.",Fahrenheit 451,"Bradbury, Ray"
2656,"A young reader finding this book today, or the day after tomorrow, is going to have to imagine first a past, and then a future that belongs to that past.",Fahrenheit 451,"Bradbury, Ray"
2657,"But still, the heart of the book remains untouched, and the questions Bradbury raises remain as valid and important.",Fahrenheit 451,"Bradbury, Ray"
2658,"Why do we need the things in books? The poems, the essays, the stories? Authors disagree. Authors are human and fallible and foolish. Stories are lies after all, tales of people who never existed and the things that never actually happened to them. Why should we read them? Why should we care?",Fahrenheit 451,"Bradbury, Ray"
2659,The teller and the tale are very different. We must not forget that.,Fahrenheit 451,"Bradbury, Ray"
2660,"Ideasîwritten ideasîare special. They are the way we transmit our stories and our thoughts from one generation to the next. If we lose them, we lose our shared history. We lose much of what makes us human. And fiction gives us empathy: it puts us inside the minds of other people, gives us the gift of seeing the world through their eyes. Fiction is a lie that tells us true things, over and over.",Fahrenheit 451,"Bradbury, Ray"
2661,"I knew Ray Bradbury for the last thirty years of his life, and I was so lucky. He was funny and gentle and always (even at the end, when he was so old he was blind and wheelchair-bound, even then) enthusiastic. He cared, completely and utterly, about things. He cared about toys and childhood and films. He cared about books. He cared about stories.",Fahrenheit 451,"Bradbury, Ray"
2662,"This is a book about caring for things. Its a love letter to books, but I think, just as much, its a love letter to people, and a love letter to the world of Waukegan, Illinois, in the 1920s, the world in which Ray Bradbury had grown up and which he immortalized as Green Town in his book of childhood, Dandelion Wine.",Fahrenheit 451,"Bradbury, Ray"
2663,"As I said when we began: If someone tells you what a story is about, they are probably right. If they tell you that that is all the story is about, they are probably wrong.

With the brass nozzle in his fists, with this great python spitting its venomous kerosene upon the world, the blood pounded in his head, and his hands were the hands of some amazing conductor playing all the symphonies of blazing and burning to bring down the tatters and charcoal ruins of history. With his symbolic helmet numbered 451 on his stolid head, and his eyes all orange flame with the thought of what came next, he flicked the igniter and the house jumped up in a gorging fire that burned the evening sky red and yellow and black. He strode in a swarm of fireflies.

2679,"The last few nights he had had the most uncertain feelings about the sidewalk just around the corner here, moving in the starlight toward his house. He had felt that a moment prior to his making the turn, someone had been there. The air seemed charged with a special calm as if someone had waited there, quietly, and only a moment before he came, simply turned to a shadow and let him through. Perhaps his nose detected a faint perfume, perhaps the skin on the backs of his hands, on his face, felt the temperature rise at this one spot where a persons standing might raise the immediate atmosphere ten degrees for an instant. There was no understanding it.

It was a look, almost, of pale surprise; the dark eyes were so fixed to the world that no move escaped them. Her dress was white and it whispered.

But the strangely comfortable and rare and gently flattering light of the candle. One time, as a child, in a power failure, his mother had found and lit a last candle and there had been a brief hour of rediscovery, of such illumination that space lost its vast dimensions and drew comfortably around them, and they, mother and son, alone, transformed, hoping that the power might not come on again too soon. . . .",Fahrenheit 451,"Bradbury, Ray"

2718,"I dont mean to be insulting. Its just I love to watch people too much, I guess.ù",Fahrenheit 451,"Bradbury, Ray"
2719,"Well, doesnt this mean anything to you?ù He tapped the numerals 451 stitched on his char-colored sleeve.",Fahrenheit 451,"Bradbury, Ray"
2720,"Yes,ù she whispered. She increased her pace. Have you ever watched the jet cars racing on the boulevards down that way?ù",Fahrenheit 451,"Bradbury, Ray"
2721,Youre changing the subject!ù,Fahrenheit 451,"Bradbury, Ray"
2722,"I sometimes think drivers dont know what grass is, or flowers, because they never see them slowly,ù she said. If you showed a driver a green blur, Oh yes! hed say, thats grass! A pink blur? Thats a rose garden! White blurs are houses. Brown blurs are cows. My uncle drove slowly on a highway once. He drove forty miles an hour and they jailed him for two days. Isnt that funny, and sad, too?ù",Fahrenheit 451,"Bradbury, Ray"
2723,"You think too many things,ù said Montag, uneasily.",Fahrenheit 451,"Bradbury, Ray"
2724,"I rarely watch the òparlor walls or go to races or Fun Parks. So Ive lots of time for crazy thoughts, I guess. Have you seen the two-hundred-foot-long billboards in the country beyond town? Did you know that once billboards were only twenty feet long? But cars started rushing by so quickly they had to stretch the advertising out so it would last.ù",Fahrenheit 451,"Bradbury, Ray"
2725,I didnt know that!ù Montag laughed abruptly.,Fahrenheit 451,"Bradbury, Ray"
2726,Bet I know something else you dont. Theres dew on the grass in the morning.ù,Fahrenheit 451,"Bradbury, Ray"
2727,"He suddenly couldnt remember if he had known this or not, and it made him quite irritable.",Fahrenheit 451,"Bradbury, Ray"

2729,He hadnt looked for a long time.,Fahrenheit 451,"Bradbury, Ray"
2730,"They walked the rest of the way in silence, hers thoughtful, his a kind of clenching and uncomfortable silence in which he shot her accusing glances. When they reached her house all its lights were blazing.",Fahrenheit 451,"Bradbury, Ray"
2731,Whats going on?ù Montag had rarely seen that many house lights.,Fahrenheit 451,"Bradbury, Ray"
2732,"Oh, just my mother and father and uncle sitting around, talking. Its like being a pedestrian, only rarer. My uncle was arrested another timeîdid I tell you?îfor being a pedestrian. Oh, were most peculiar.ù",Fahrenheit 451,"Bradbury, Ray"
2733,But what do you talk about?ù,Fahrenheit 451,"Bradbury, Ray"
2734,She laughed at this. Good night!ù She started up her walk. Then she seemed to remember something and came back to look at him with wonder and curiosity. Are you happy?ù she said.,Fahrenheit 451,"Bradbury, Ray"
2735,Am I what?ù he cried.,Fahrenheit 451,"Bradbury, Ray"
2736,But she was goneîrunning in the moonlight. Her front door shut gently.,Fahrenheit 451,"Bradbury, Ray"
2737,  ,Fahrenheit 451,"Bradbury, Ray"
2738,Happy! Of all the nonsense.ù,Fahrenheit 451,"Bradbury, Ray"
2739,He stopped laughing.,Fahrenheit 451,"Bradbury, Ray"
2740,He put his hand into the glove hole of his front door and let it know his touch. The front door slid open.,Fahrenheit 451,"Bradbury, Ray"
2741,"Of course Im happy. What does she think? Im not? he asked the quiet rooms. He stood looking up at the ventilator grill in the hall and suddenly remembered that something lay hidden behind the grill, something that seemed to peer down at him now. He moved his eyes quickly away.",Fahrenheit 451,"Bradbury, Ray"
2742,What a strange meeting on a strange night. He remembered nothing like it save one afternoon a year ago when he had met an old man in the park and they had talked. . . .,Fahrenheit 451,"Bradbury, Ray"
2743,"Montag shook his head. He looked at a blank wall. The girls face was there, really quite beautiful in memory: astonishing, in fact. She had a very thin face like the dial of a small clock seen faintly in a dark room in the middle of a night when you waken to see the time and see the clock telling you the hour and the minute and the second, with a white silence and a glowing, all certainty and knowing what it has to tell of the night passing swiftly on toward further darknesses, but moving also toward a new sun.",Fahrenheit 451,"Bradbury, Ray"
2744,"What?ù asked Montag of that other self, the subconscious idiot that ran babbling at times, quite independent of will, habit, and conscience.",Fahrenheit 451,"Bradbury, Ray"
2745,"He glanced back at the wall. How like a mirror, too, her face. Impossible; for how many people did you know that refracted your own light to you? People were more oftenîhe searched for a simile, found one in his workîtorches, blazing away until they whiffed out. How rarely did other peoples faces take of you and throw back to you your own expression, your own innermost trembling thought?",Fahrenheit 451,"Bradbury, Ray"
2746,"What incredible power of identification the girl had; she was like the eager watcher of a marionette show, anticipating each flicker of an eyelid, each gesture of his hand, each flick of a finger, the moment before it began. How long had they walked together? Three minutes? Five? Yet how large that time seemed now. How immense a figure she was on the stage before him; what a shadow she threw on the wall with her slender body! He felt that if his eye itched, she might blink. And if the muscles of his jaws stretched imperceptibly, she would yawn long before he would.",Fahrenheit 451,"Bradbury, Ray"
2747,"Why, he thought, now that I think of it, she almost seemed to be waiting for me there, in the street, so damned late at night. . . .",Fahrenheit 451,"Bradbury, Ray"
2748,He opened the bedroom door.,Fahrenheit 451,"Bradbury, Ray"
2749,"It was like coming into the cold marbled room of a mausoleum after the moon has set. Complete darkness, not a hint of the silver world outside, the windows tightly shut, the chamber a tomb-world where no sound from the great city could penetrate. The room was not empty.",Fahrenheit 451,"Bradbury, Ray"
2750,He listened.,Fahrenheit 451,"Bradbury, Ray"
2751,"The little mosquito-delicate dancing hum in the air, the electrical murmur of a hidden wasp snug in its special pink warm nest. The music was almost loud enough so he could follow the tune.",Fahrenheit 451,"Bradbury, Ray"
2752,"He felt his smile slide away, melt, fold over and down on itself like a tallow skin, like the stuff of a fantastic candle burning too long and now collapsing and now blown out. Darkness. He was not happy. He was not happy. He said the words to himself. He recognized this as the true state of affairs. He wore his happiness like a mask and the girl had run off across the lawn with the mask and there was no way of going to knock on her door and ask for it back.",Fahrenheit 451,"Bradbury, Ray"
2753,"Without turning on the light he imagined how this room would look. His wife stretched on the bed, uncovered and cold, like a body displayed on the lid of a tomb, her eyes fixed to the ceiling by invisible threads of steel, immovable. And in her ears the little Seashells, the thimble radios tamped tight, and an electronic ocean of sound, of music and talk and music and talk coming in, coming in on the shore of her unsleeping mind. The room was indeed empty. Every night the waves came in and bore her off on their great tides of sound, floating her, wide-eyed, toward morning. There had been no night in the last two years that Mildred had not swum that sea, had not gladly gone down in it for the third time.",Fahrenheit 451,"Bradbury, Ray"
2754,"The room was cold but nonetheless he felt he could not breathe. He did not wish to open the drapes and open the French windows, for he did not want the moon to come into the room. So, with the feeling of a man who will die in the next hour for lack of air, he felt his way toward his open, separate, and therefore cold bed.",Fahrenheit 451,"Bradbury, Ray"
2755,"An instant before his foot hit the object on the floor he knew he would hit such an object. It was not unlike the feeling he had experienced before turning the corner and almost knocking the girl down. His foot, sending vibrations ahead, received back echoes of the small barrier across its path even as the foot swung. His foot kicked. The object gave a dull clink and slid off in darkness.",Fahrenheit 451,"Bradbury, Ray"
2756,"He stood very straight and listened to the person on the dark bed in the completely featureless night. The breath coming out the nostrils was so faint it stirred only the furthest fringes of life, a small leaf, a black feather, a single fiber of hair.",Fahrenheit 451,"Bradbury, Ray"
2757,"He still did not want outside light. He pulled out his igniter, felt the salamander etched on its silver disc, gave it a flick. . . .",Fahrenheit 451,"Bradbury, Ray"
2758,"Two moonstones looked up at him in the light of his small hand-held fire; two pale moonstones buried in a creek of clear water over which the life of the world ran, not touching them.",Fahrenheit 451,"Bradbury, Ray"
2759,Mildred!ù,Fahrenheit 451,"Bradbury, Ray"
2760,"Her face was like a snow-covered island upon which rain might fall, but it felt no rain; over which clouds might pass their moving shadows, but she felt no shadow. There was only the singing of the thimble-wasps in her tamped-shut ears, and her eyes all glass, and breath going in and out, softly, faintly, in and out her nostrils, and her not caring whether it came or went, went or came.",Fahrenheit 451,"Bradbury, Ray"
2761,The object he had sent tumbling with his foot now glinted under the edge of his own bed. The small crystal bottle of sleeping tablets which earlier today had been filled with thirty capsules and which now lay uncapped and empty in the light of the tiny flare.,Fahrenheit 451,"Bradbury, Ray"
2762,"As he stood there the sky over the house screamed. There was a tremendous ripping sound as if two giant hands had torn ten thousand miles of black linen down the seam. Montag was cut in half. He felt his chest chopped down and split apart. The jet bombers going over, going over, going over, one two, one two, one two, six of them, nine of them, twelve of them, one and one and one and another and another and another, did all the screaming for him. He opened his own mouth and let their shriek come down and out between his bared teeth. The house shook. The flare went out in his hand. The moonstones vanished. He felt his hand plunge toward the telephone.",Fahrenheit 451,"Bradbury, Ray"
2763,"The jets were gone. He felt his lips move, brushing the mouthpiece of the phone. Emergency hospital.ù A terrible whisper.",Fahrenheit 451,"Bradbury, Ray"
2764,"He felt that the stars had been pulverized by the sound of the black jets and that in the morning the earth would be covered with their dust like a strange snow. That was his idiot thought as he stood shivering in the dark, and let his lips go on moving and moving.",Fahrenheit 451,"Bradbury, Ray"

2766,"They had this machine. They had two machines, really. One of them slid down into your stomach like a black cobra down an echoing well looking for all the old water and the old time gathered there. It drank up the green matter that flowed to the top in a slow boil. Did it drink of the darkness? Did it suck out all the poisons accumulated with the years? It fed in silence with an occasional sound of inner suffocation and blind searching. It had an Eye. The impersonal operator of the machine could, by wearing a special optical helmet, gaze into the soul of the person whom he was pumping out. What did the Eye see? He did not say. He saw but did not see what the Eye saw. The entire operation was not unlike the digging of a trench in ones yard. The woman on the bed was no more than a hard stratum of marble they had reached. Go on, anyway, shove the bore down, slush up the emptiness, if such a thing could be brought out in the throb of the suction snake. The operator stood smoking a cigarette. The other machine was working, too.",Fahrenheit 451,"Bradbury, Ray"
2767,"The other machine, operated by an equally impersonal fellow in nonstainable reddish-brown coveralls. This machine pumped all of the blood from the body and replaced it with fresh blood and serum.",Fahrenheit 451,"Bradbury, Ray"
2768,"Got to clean em out both ways,ù said the operator, standing over the silent woman. No use getting the stomach if you dont clean the blood.

2771,Are you done?ù said Montag.,Fahrenheit 451,"Bradbury, Ray"
2772,They shut the machines up tight. Were done.ù His anger did not even touch them. They stood with the cigarette smoke curling around their noses and into their eyes without making them blink or squint. Thats fifty bucks.ù,Fahrenheit 451,"Bradbury, Ray"
2773,"First, why dont you tell me if shell be all right?ù",Fahrenheit 451,"Bradbury, Ray"
2774,"Sure, shell be okay. We got all the mean stuff right in our suitcase here, it cant get at her now. As I said, you take out the old and put in the new and youre okay.ù",Fahrenheit 451,"Bradbury, Ray"
2775,Neither of you is an M.D. Why didnt they send an M.D. from Emergency?ù,Fahrenheit 451,"Bradbury, Ray"
2776,"Hell!ù The operators cigarette moved on his lip. We get these cases nine or ten a night. Got so many, starting a few years ago, we had the special machines built. With the optical lens, of course, that was new; the rest is ancient. You dont need an M.D., case like this; all you need is two handymen, clean up the problem in half an hour. Lookùîhe started for the doorîwe gotta go. Just had another call on the old ear-thimble. Ten blocks from here. Someone else just jumped off the cap of a pillbox. Call if you need us again. Keep her quiet. We got a contrasedative in her. Shell wake up hungry. So long.ù",Fahrenheit 451,"Bradbury, Ray"

2779,"Mildred,ù he said, at last.",Fahrenheit 451,"Bradbury, Ray"
2780,"There are too many of us, he thought. There are billions of us and thats too many. Nobody knows anyone. Strangers come and violate you. Strangers come and cut your heart out.

2781,Half an hour passed.,Fahrenheit 451,"Bradbury, Ray"
2782,The bloodstream in this woman was new and it seemed to have done a new thing to her. Her cheeks were very pink and her lips were very fresh and full of color and they looked soft and relaxed.

2784,"Laughter blew across the moon-colored lawn from the house of Clarisse and her father and mother and the uncle who smiled so quietly and so earnestly. Above all, their laughter was relaxed and hearty and not forced in any way, coming from the house that was so brightly lit this late at night while all the other houses were kept to themselves in darkness.

2785,"Montag moved out through the French windows and crossed the lawn, without even thinking of it.

For that matter, what color jerseys are they wearing as they trot out on the field?ù",Fahrenheit 451,"Bradbury, Ray"

The animals were turned loose. Three seconds later the game was done, the rat, cat, or chicken caught half across the areaway, gripped in gentling paws while a four-inch hollow steel needle plunged down from the proboscis of the Hound to inject massive jolts of morphine or procaine. The pawn was then tossed in the incinerator. A new game began.",Fahrenheit 451,"Bradbury, Ray"

There had been a time two years ago when he had bet with the best of them, and lost a weeks salary and faced Mildreds insane anger, which showed itself in veins and blotches. But now nights he lay in his bunk, face turned to the wall, listening to the whoops of laughter below and the pianostring scurry of rat feet, the violin squeaking of mice, and the great shadowing, motioned silence of the Hound leaping out like a moth in the raw light, finding, holding its victim, inserting needle and going back to its kennel to die as if a switch had been turned.",Fahrenheit 451,"Bradbury, Ray"

Below, the Hound had sunk back down upon its eight incredible insect legs and was humming to itself again, its multifaceted eyes at peace.",Fahrenheit 451,"Bradbury, Ray"
2905,"Montag stood, letting the fears pass, by the drop-hole. Behind him, four men at a card table under a greenlidded light in the corner glanced briefly but said nothing.

3014," òPlay the man, Master Ridley; we shall this day light such a candle, by Gods grace, in England, as I trust shall never be put out. ù",Fahrenheit 451,"Bradbury, Ray"
3015,Enough of that!ù said Beatty. Where are they?ù,Fahrenheit 451,"Bradbury, Ray"
3016,"He slapped her face with amazing objectivity and repeated the question. The old womans eyes came to a focus upon Beatty. You know where they are or you wouldnt be here,ù she said.",Fahrenheit 451,"Bradbury, Ray"
3017,Stoneman held out the telephone alarm card with the complaint signed in telephone duplicate on the back:,Fahrenheit 451,"Bradbury, Ray"

3020,"All right, men, lets get em!ù",Fahrenheit 451,"Bradbury, Ray"
3021,"Next thing they were up in musty blackness swinging silver hatchets at doors that were, after all, unlocked, tumbling through like boys all rollick and shout. Hey!ù A fountain of books sprang down upon Montag as he climbed shuddering up the sheer stairwell. How inconvenient! Always before it had been like snuffing a candle. The police went first and adhesive-taped the victims mouth and bandaged him off into their glittering beetle cars, so when you arrived you found an empty house. You werent hurting anyone, you were hurting only things! And since things really couldnt be hurt, since things felt nothing, and things dont scream or whimper, as this woman might begin to scream and cry out, there was nothing to tease your conscience later. You were simply cleaning up. Janitorial work, essentially. Everything to its proper place. Quick with the kerosene! Whos got a match!",Fahrenheit 451,"Bradbury, Ray"
3022,"But now, tonight, someone had slipped. This woman was spoiling the ritual. The men were making too much noise, laughing, joking, to cover her terrible accusing silence below. She made the empty rooms roar with accusation and shake down a fine dust of guilt that was sucked in their nostrils as they plunged about. It was neither cricket nor correct. Montag felt an immense irritation. She shouldnt be here, on top of everything!",Fahrenheit 451,"Bradbury, Ray"
3023,"Books bombarded his shoulders, his arms, his upturned face. A book lit, almost obediently, like a white pigeon, in his hands, wings fluttering. In the dim, wavering light, a page hung open and it was like a snowy feather, the words delicately painted thereon. In all the rush and fervor, Montag had only an instant to read a line, but it blazed in his mind for the next minute as if stamped there with fiery steel. Time has fallen asleep in the afternoon sunshine.ù He dropped the book. Immediately, another fell into his arms.",Fahrenheit 451,"Bradbury, Ray"
3024,"Montag, up here!ù",Fahrenheit 451,"Bradbury, Ray"
3025,"Montags hand closed like a mouth, crushed the book with wild devotion, with an insanity of mindlessness to his chest. The men above were hurling shovelfuls of magazines into the dusty air. They fell like slaughtered birds and the woman stood below, like a small girl, among the bodies.",Fahrenheit 451,"Bradbury, Ray"
3026,"Montag had done nothing. His hand had done it all, his hand, with a brain of its own, with a conscience and a curiosity in each trembling finger, had turned thief. Now, it plunged the book back under his arm, pressed it tight to sweating armpit, rushed out empty, with a magicians flourish! Look here! Innocent! Look!",Fahrenheit 451,"Bradbury, Ray"
3027,"He gazed, shaken, at that white hand. He held it way out, as if he were farsighted. He held it close, as if he were blind.",Fahrenheit 451,"Bradbury, Ray"
3028,Montag!ù,Fahrenheit 451,"Bradbury, Ray"
3029,He jerked about.,Fahrenheit 451,"Bradbury, Ray"
3030,"Dont stand there, idiot!ù",Fahrenheit 451,"Bradbury, Ray"
3031,"The books lay like great mounds of fishes left to dry. The men danced and slipped and fell over them. Titles glittered their golden eyes, falling, gone.",Fahrenheit 451,"Bradbury, Ray"
3032,Kerosene!ù,Fahrenheit 451,"Bradbury, Ray"
3033,"They pumped the cold fluid from the numeraled 451 tanks strapped to their shoulders. They coated each book, they pumped rooms full of it.",Fahrenheit 451,"Bradbury, Ray"
3034,"They hurried downstairs, Montag staggering after them in the kerosene fumes.",Fahrenheit 451,"Bradbury, Ray"
3035,"Come on, woman!ù",Fahrenheit 451,"Bradbury, Ray"
3036,"The woman knelt among the books, touching the drenched leather and cardboard, reading the gilt titles with her fingers while her eyes accused Montag.",Fahrenheit 451,"Bradbury, Ray"
3037,"You cant ever have my books,ù she said.",Fahrenheit 451,"Bradbury, Ray"
3038,"You know the law,ù said Beatty. Wheres your common sense? None of those books agree with each other. Youve been locked up here for years with a regular damned Tower of Babel. Snap out of it! The people in those books never lived. Come on now!ù",Fahrenheit 451,"Bradbury, Ray"
3039,She shook her head.,Fahrenheit 451,"Bradbury, Ray"
3040,"The whole house is going up,ù said Beatty.",Fahrenheit 451,"Bradbury, Ray"
3041,"The men walked clumsily to the door. They glanced back at Montag, who stood near the woman.",Fahrenheit 451,"Bradbury, Ray"
3042,Youre not leaving her here?ù he protested.,Fahrenheit 451,"Bradbury, Ray"
3043,She wont come.ù,Fahrenheit 451,"Bradbury, Ray"
3044,"Force her, then!ù",Fahrenheit 451,"Bradbury, Ray"
3045,"Beatty raised his hand in which was concealed the igniter. Were due back at the House. Besides, these fanatics always try suicide; the patterns familiar.ù",Fahrenheit 451,"Bradbury, Ray"
3046,Montag placed his hand on the womans elbow. You can come with me.ù,Fahrenheit 451,"Bradbury, Ray"
3047,"No,ù she said. Thank you, anyway.ù",Fahrenheit 451,"Bradbury, Ray"
3048,"Im counting to ten,ù said Beatty. One. Two.ù",Fahrenheit 451,"Bradbury, Ray"
3049,"Please,ù said Montag.",Fahrenheit 451,"Bradbury, Ray"
3050,"Go on,ù said the woman.",Fahrenheit 451,"Bradbury, Ray"
3051,Three. Four.ù,Fahrenheit 451,"Bradbury, Ray"
3052,Here.ù Montag pulled at the woman.,Fahrenheit 451,"Bradbury, Ray"
3053,"The woman replied quietly, I want to stay here.ù",Fahrenheit 451,"Bradbury, Ray"
3054,Five. Six.ù,Fahrenheit 451,"Bradbury, Ray"
3055,"You can stop counting,ù she said. She opened the fingers of one hand slightly and in the palm of the hand was a single slender object.",Fahrenheit 451,"Bradbury, Ray"
3056,An ordinary kitchen match.,Fahrenheit 451,"Bradbury, Ray"
3057,"The sight of it rushed the men out and down away from the house. Captain Beatty, keeping his dignity, backed slowly through the front door, his pink face burnt and shiny from a thousand fires and night excitements. God, thought Montag, how true! Always at night the alarm comes. Never by day! Is it because fire is prettier by night? More spectacle, a better show? The pink face of Beatty now showed the faintest panic in the door. The womans hand twitched on the single matchstick. The fumes of kerosene bloomed up about her. Montag felt the hidden book pound like a heart against his chest.",Fahrenheit 451,"Bradbury, Ray"
3058,"Go on,ù said the woman, and Montag felt himself back away and away out the door, after Beatty, down the steps, across the lawn, where the path of kerosene lay like the track of some evil snail.",Fahrenheit 451,"Bradbury, Ray"
3059,"On the front porch where she had come to weigh them quietly with her eyes, her quietness a condemnation, the woman stood motionless.",Fahrenheit 451,"Bradbury, Ray"
3060,Beatty flicked his fingers to spark the kerosene.,Fahrenheit 451,"Bradbury, Ray"
3061,He was too late. Montag gasped.,Fahrenheit 451,"Bradbury, Ray"
3062,"The woman on the porch reached out with contempt to them all, and struck the kitchen match against the railing.",Fahrenheit 451,"Bradbury, Ray"
3063,People ran out of houses all down the street.,Fahrenheit 451,"Bradbury, Ray"
3064,  ,Fahrenheit 451,"Bradbury, Ray"
3065,They said nothing on their way back to the firehouse. Nobody looked at anyone else. Montag sat in the front seat with Beatty and Black. They did not even smoke their pipes. They sat there looking out the front of the great Salamander as they turned a corner and went silently on.,Fahrenheit 451,"Bradbury, Ray"
3066,"Master Ridley,ù said Montag a last.",Fahrenheit 451,"Bradbury, Ray"
3067,What?ù said Beatty.,Fahrenheit 451,"Bradbury, Ray"
3068,"She said, òMaster Ridley. She said some crazy thing when we came in the door. òPlay the man, she said, òMaster Ridley. Something, something, something.ù",Fahrenheit 451,"Bradbury, Ray"
3069," òWe shall this day light such a candle, by Gods grace, in England, as I trust shall never be put out, ù said Beatty. Stoneman glanced over at the Captain, as did Montag, startled.",Fahrenheit 451,"Bradbury, Ray"
3070,"Beatty rubbed his chin. A man named Latimer said that to a man named Nicholas Ridley, as they were being burnt alive at Oxford, for heresy, on October 16, 1555.ù",Fahrenheit 451,"Bradbury, Ray"
3071,Montag and Stoneman went back to looking at the street as it moved under the engine wheels.,Fahrenheit 451,"Bradbury, Ray"
3072,"Im full of bits and pieces,ù said Beatty. Most fire captains have to be. Sometimes I surprise myself. Watch it, Stoneman!ù",Fahrenheit 451,"Bradbury, Ray"
3073,Stoneman braked the truck.,Fahrenheit 451,"Bradbury, Ray"
3074,Damn!ù said Beatty. Youve gone right by the corner where we turn for the firehouse.ù,Fahrenheit 451,"Bradbury, Ray"
3075,  ,Fahrenheit 451,"Bradbury, Ray"
3076,Who is it?ù,Fahrenheit 451,"Bradbury, Ray"
3077,"Who would it be?ù said Montag, leaning back against the closed door in the dark.",Fahrenheit 451,"Bradbury, Ray"
3078,"His wife said, at last, Well, put on the light.ù",Fahrenheit 451,"Bradbury, Ray"
3079,I dont want the light.ù,Fahrenheit 451,"Bradbury, Ray"
3080,Come to bed.ù,Fahrenheit 451,"Bradbury, Ray"
3081,He heard her roll impatiently; the bedsprings squealed.,Fahrenheit 451,"Bradbury, Ray"
3082,Are you drunk?ù she said.,Fahrenheit 451,"Bradbury, Ray"
3083,"So it was the hand that started it all. He felt one hand and then the other work his coat free and let it slump to the floor. He held his pants out into an abyss and let them fall into darkness. His hands had been infected, and soon it would be his arms. He could feel the poison working up his wrists and into his elbows and his shoulders, and then the jump-over from shoulder blade to shoulder blade like a spark leaping a gap. His hands were ravenous. And his eyes were beginning to feel hunger, as if they must look at something, anything, everything.",Fahrenheit 451,"Bradbury, Ray"
3084,"His wife said, What are you doing?ù",Fahrenheit 451,"Bradbury, Ray"
3085,He balanced in space with the book in his sweating cold fingers.,Fahrenheit 451,"Bradbury, Ray"
3086,"A minute later she said, Well, just dont stand there in the middle of the floor.ù",Fahrenheit 451,"Bradbury, Ray"
3087,He made a small sound.,Fahrenheit 451,"Bradbury, Ray"
3088,What?ù she asked.,Fahrenheit 451,"Bradbury, Ray"
3089,"He made more soft sounds. He stumbled toward the bed and shoved the book clumsily under the cold pillow. He fell into bed and his wife cried out, startled. He lay far across the room from her, on a winter island separated by an empty sea. She talked to him for what seemed a long while and she talked about this and she talked about that and it was only words, like the words he had heard once in a nursery at a friends house, a two-year-old child building word patterns, talking jargon, making pretty sounds in the air. But Montag said nothing and after a long while when he only made the small sounds, he felt her move in the room and come to his bed and stand over him and put her hand down to feel his cheek. He knew that when she pulled her hand away from his face it was wet.",Fahrenheit 451,"Bradbury, Ray"
3090,  ,Fahrenheit 451,"Bradbury, Ray"
3091,"Late in the night he looked over at Mildred. She was awake. There was a tiny dance of melody in the air, her Seashell was tamped in her ear again and she was listening to far people in far places, her eyes wide and staring at the fathoms of blackness above her in the ceiling.",Fahrenheit 451,"Bradbury, Ray"
3092,"Wasnt there an old joke about the wife who talked so much on the telephone that her desperate husband ran out to the nearest store and telephoned her to ask what was for dinner? Well, then, why didnt he buy himself an audio-Seashell broadcasting station and talk to his wife late at night, murmur, whisper, shout, scream, yell. But what would he whisper, what would he yell? What could he say?",Fahrenheit 451,"Bradbury, Ray"
3093,"And suddenly she was so strange he couldnt believe he knew her at all. He was in someone elses house, like those other jokes people told of the gentleman, drunk, coming home late late at night, unlocking the wrong door, entering a wrong room, and bedding with a stranger and getting up early and going to work and neither of them the wiser.",Fahrenheit 451,"Bradbury, Ray"
3094,Millie . . . ?ù he whispered.,Fahrenheit 451,"Bradbury, Ray"
3095,What?ù,Fahrenheit 451,"Bradbury, Ray"
3096,I didnt mean to startle you. What I want to know is . . .ù,Fahrenheit 451,"Bradbury, Ray"
3097,Well?ù,Fahrenheit 451,"Bradbury, Ray"
3098,When did we meet? And where?ù,Fahrenheit 451,"Bradbury, Ray"
3099,When did we meet for what?ù she asked.,Fahrenheit 451,"Bradbury, Ray"
3100,I meanîoriginally.ù,Fahrenheit 451,"Bradbury, Ray"
3101,He knew she must be frowning in the dark.,Fahrenheit 451,"Bradbury, Ray"
3102,"He clarified it. The first time we ever met, where was it, and when?ù",Fahrenheit 451,"Bradbury, Ray"
3103,"Why, it was atîù",Fahrenheit 451,"Bradbury, Ray"
3104,She stopped.,Fahrenheit 451,"Bradbury, Ray"
3105,"I dont know,ù she said.",Fahrenheit 451,"Bradbury, Ray"
3106,He was cold. Cant you remember?ù,Fahrenheit 451,"Bradbury, Ray"
3107,Its been so long.ù,Fahrenheit 451,"Bradbury, Ray"
3108,"Only ten years, thats all, only ten!ù",Fahrenheit 451,"Bradbury, Ray"
3109,"Dont get excited, Im trying to think.ù She laughed an odd little laugh that went up and up. Funny, how funny, not to remember where or when you met your husband or wife.ù",Fahrenheit 451,"Bradbury, Ray"
3110,"He lay massaging his eyes, his brow, and the back of his neck, slowly. He held both hands over his eyes and applied a steady pressure there as if to crush memory into place. It was suddenly more important than any other thing in a lifetime that he know where he had met Mildred.",Fahrenheit 451,"Bradbury, Ray"
3111,"It doesnt matter.ù She was up, in the bathroom now, and he heard the water running, and the swallowing sound she made.",Fahrenheit 451,"Bradbury, Ray"
3112,"No, I guess not,ù he said.",Fahrenheit 451,"Bradbury, Ray"
3113,"He tried to count how many times she swallowed and he thought of the visit from the two zinc-oxide-faced men with the cigarettes in their straight-lined mouths and the Electronic-Eyed Snake winding down into the layer upon layer of night and stone and stagnant spring water, and he wanted to call out to her, how many have you taken tonight! the capsules! how many will you take later and not know? and so on, every hour! or maybe not tonight, tomorrow night! And me not sleeping tonight or tomorrow night or any night for a long while, now that this has started. And he thought of her lying on the bed with the two technicians standing straight over her, not bent with concern, but only standing straight, arms folded. And he remembered thinking then that if she died, he was certain he wouldnt cry. For it would be the dying of an unknown, a street face, a newspaper image, and it was suddenly so very wrong that he had begun to cry, not at death but at the thought of not crying at death, a silly empty man near a silly empty woman, while the hungry snake made her still more empty.",Fahrenheit 451,"Bradbury, Ray"
3114,"How do you get so empty? he wondered. Who takes it out of you? And that awful flower the other day, the dandelion! It had summed up everything, hadnt it? What a shame! Youre not in love with anyone!ù And why not?",Fahrenheit 451,"Bradbury, Ray"
3115,"Well, wasnt there a wall between him and Mildred, when you came down to it? Literally not just one wall but, so far, three! And expensive, too! And the uncles, the aunts, the cousins, the nieces, the nephews, that lived in those walls, the gibbering pack of tree-apes that said nothing, nothing, nothing and said it loud, loud, loud. He had taken to calling them relatives from the very first. Hows Uncle Louis today?ù Who?ù And Aunt Maude?ù The most significant memory he had of Mildred, really, was of a little girl in a forest without trees (how odd!) or rather a little girl lost on a plateau where there used to be trees (you could feel the memory of their shapes all about) sitting in the center of the living room.ù The living room; what a good job of labeling that was now. No matter when he came in, the walls were always talking to Mildred.",Fahrenheit 451,"Bradbury, Ray"
3116,Something must be done!ù,Fahrenheit 451,"Bradbury, Ray"
3117,"Yes, something must be done!ù",Fahrenheit 451,"Bradbury, Ray"
3118,"Well, lets not stand and talk!ù",Fahrenheit 451,"Bradbury, Ray"
3119,Lets do it!ù,Fahrenheit 451,"Bradbury, Ray"
3120,Im so mad I could spit!ù,Fahrenheit 451,"Bradbury, Ray"
3121,"What was it all about? Mildred couldnt say. Who was mad at whom? Mildred didnt quite know. What were they going to do? Well, said Mildred, wait around and see.",Fahrenheit 451,"Bradbury, Ray"
3122,He had waited around to see.,Fahrenheit 451,"Bradbury, Ray"
3123,"A great thunderstorm of sound gushed from the walls. Music bombarded him at such an immense volume that his bones were almost shaken from their tendons; he felt his jaw vibrate, his eyes wobble in his head. He was a victim of concussion. When it was all over he felt like a man who had been thrown from a cliff, whirled in a centrifuge and spat out over a waterfall that fell and fell into emptiness and emptiness and neverîquiteîtouchedîbottomîneverîneverîquiteîno not quiteîtouchedîbottom . . . and you fell so fast you didnt touch the sides either . . . never . . . quite . . . touched . . . anything.",Fahrenheit 451,"Bradbury, Ray"
3124,The thunder faded. The music died.,Fahrenheit 451,"Bradbury, Ray"
3125,"There,ù said Mildred.",Fahrenheit 451,"Bradbury, Ray"
3126,"And it was indeed remarkable. Something had happened. Even though the people in the walls of the room had barely moved, and nothing had really been settled, you had the impression that someone had turned on a washing machine or sucked you up in a gigantic vacuum. You drowned in music and pure cacophony. He came out of the room sweating and on the point of collapse. Behind him, Mildred sat in her chair and the voices went on again:",Fahrenheit 451,"Bradbury, Ray"
3127,"Well, everything will be all right now,ù said an aunt.ù",Fahrenheit 451,"Bradbury, Ray"
3128,"Oh, dont be too sure,ù said a cousin.ù",Fahrenheit 451,"Bradbury, Ray"

3135,Because!ù,Fahrenheit 451,"Bradbury, Ray"
3136,"Thats all very well,ù cried Montag, but what are they mad about? Who are these people? Whos that man and whos that woman? Are they husband and wife, are they divorced, engaged, what? Good God, nothings connected up.ù",Fahrenheit 451,"Bradbury, Ray"
3137,"Theyîù said Mildredîwell, theyîthey had this fight, you see. They certainly fight a lot. You should listen. I think theyre married. Yes, theyre married. Why?ù",Fahrenheit 451,"Bradbury, Ray"
3138,"And if it was not the three walls soon to be four walls and the dream complete, then it was the open car and Mildred driving a hundred miles an hour across town, he shouting at her and she shouting back and both trying to hear what was said, but hearing only the scream of the car. At least keep it down to the minimum!ù he yelled. What?ù she cried. Keep it down to fifty-five, the minimum!ù he shouted. The what?ù she shrieked. Speed!ù he shouted. And she pushed it up to one hundred and five miles an hour and tore the breath from his mouth.",Fahrenheit 451,"Bradbury, Ray"
3139,"When they stepped out of the car, she had the Seashells stuffed in her ears.",Fahrenheit 451,"Bradbury, Ray"
3140,Silence. Only the wind blowing softly.,Fahrenheit 451,"Bradbury, Ray"
3141,Mildred.ù He stirred in bed.,Fahrenheit 451,"Bradbury, Ray"
3142,He reached over and pulled the tiny musical insect out of her ear. Mildred. Mildred?ù,Fahrenheit 451,"Bradbury, Ray"
3143,Yes.ù Her voice was faint.,Fahrenheit 451,"Bradbury, Ray"
3144,"He felt he was one of the creatures electronically inserted between the slots of the phono-color walls, speaking, but the speech not piercing the crystal barrier.
