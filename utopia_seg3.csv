3053,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins",Herland,sentence,3684,3708,NA,That is the easiest part
3054,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins",Herland,sentence,3710,3913,NA,The other division is in arranging a properly graduated series of exercises which will best develop each mind the common faculties we all have and most carefully the especial faculties some of us have

3099,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins",Herland,sentence,2484,2601,NA,But most of our games I told her were very oldcame down from child to child along the ages from the remote past
3100,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins",Herland,sentence,2604,2630,NA,And what is their effect

3108,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins",Herland,sentence,2997,3563,NA,Are yours more contentedmore interestedhappier  Then I thought as in truth I never had thought before of the dull bored children I had seen whining What can I do now of the little groups and gangs hanging about of the value of some one strong spirit who possessed initiative and would start something of the childrens parties and the onerous duties of the older people set to amuse the children also of that troubled ocean of misdirected activity we call mischief the foolish destructive sometimes evil things done by unoccupied children

3116,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins",Herland,sentence,4393,4551,NA,They were taught as rapidly as feasible to use and control their own bodies and never did I see such surefooted steadyhanded clearheaded little things
3117,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins",Herland,sentence,4553,4834,NA,It was a joy to watch a row of toddlers learning to walk not only on a level floor but a little later on a sort of rubber rail raised an inch or two above the soft turf or heavy rugs and falling off with shrieks of infant joy to rush back to the end of the line and try again
3118,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins",Herland,sentence,4836,4917,NA,Surely we have noticed how children love to get up on something and walk along it

3123,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins",Herland,sentence,110,336,NA,If I feared at first the effects of a too intensive system of culture that fear was dissipated by seeing the long sunny days of pure physical merriment and natural sleep in which these heavenly babies passed their first years
3124,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins",Herland,sentence,338,378,NA,They never knew they were being educated
3125,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins",Herland,sentence,380,580,NA,They did not dream that in this association of hilarious experiment and achievement they were laying the foundation for that close beautiful group feeling into which they grew so firmly with the years

3128,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins",Herland,sentence,634,834,NA,Their Religions and Our Marriages   It took me a long time as a man a foreigner and a species of ChristianI was that as much as anythingto get any clear understanding of the religion of Herland
3129,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins",Herland,sentence,837,977,NA,Its deification of motherhood was obvious enough but there was far more to it than that or at least than my first interpretation of that
3130,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins",Herland,sentence,980,1201,NA,I think it was only as I grew to love Ellador more than I believed anyone could love anybody as I grew faintly to appreciate her inner attitude and state of mind that I began to get some glimpses of this faith of theirs
3131,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins",Herland,sentence,1204,1329,NA,When I asked her about it she tried at first to tell me and then seeing me flounder asked for more information about ours
3132,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins",Herland,sentence,1331,1418,NA,She soon found that we had many that they varied widely but had some points in common
3133,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins",Herland,sentence,1420,1512,NA,A clear methodical luminous mind had my Ellador not only reasonable but swiftly perceptive
3134,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins",Herland,sentence,1515,1760,NA,She made a sort of chart superimposing the different religions as I described them with a pin run through them all as it were their common basis being a Dominant Power or Powers and some Special Behavior mostly taboos to please or placate
3135,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins",Herland,sentence,1762,1928,NA,There were some common features in certain groups of religions but the one always present was this Power and the things which must be done or not done because of it
3136,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins",Herland,sentence,1930,2164,NA,It was not hard to trace our human imagery of the Divine Force up through successive stages of bloodthirsty sensual proud and cruel gods of early times to the conception of a Common Father with its corollary of a Common Brotherhood
3137,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins",Herland,sentence,2167,2355,NA,This pleased her very much and when I expatiated on the Omniscience Omnipotence Omnipresence and so on of our God and of the loving kindness taught by his Son she was much impressed
3138,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins",Herland,sentence,2358,2522,NA,The story of the Virgin birth naturally did not astonish her but she was greatly puzzled by the Sacrifice and still more by the Devil and the theory of Damnation
3139,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins",Herland,sentence,2525,2658,NA,When in an inadvertent moment I said that certain sects had believed in infant damnationand explained itshe sat very still indeed
3140,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins",Herland,sentence,2661,2738,NA,They believed that God was Loveand Wisdomand Power  Yesall of that
3141,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins",Herland,sentence,2741,2783,NA,Her eyes grew large her face ghastly pale
3142,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins",Herland,sentence,2786,2861,NA,And yet that such a God could put little new babies to burnfor eternity
3143,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins",Herland,sentence,2863,2947,NA,She fell into a sudden shuddering and left me running swiftly to the nearest temple
3144,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins",Herland,sentence,2950,3171,NA,Every smallest village had its temple and in those gracious retreats sat wise and noble women quietly busy at some work of their own until they were wanted always ready to give comfort light or help to any applicant
3145,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins",Herland,sentence,3174,3301,NA,Ellador told me afterward how easily this grief of hers was assuaged and seemed ashamed of not having helped herself out of it
3146,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins",Herland,sentence,3304,3405,NA,You see we are not accustomed to horrible ideas she said coming back to me rather apologetically
3147,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins",Herland,sentence,3407,3422,NA,We havent any
3148,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins",Herland,sentence,3424,3516,NA,And when we get a thing like that into our minds its likeoh like red pepper in your eyes
3149,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins",Herland,sentence,3518,3620,NA,So I just ran to her blinded and almost screaming and she took it out so quicklyso easily  How
3150,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins",Herland,sentence,3622,3643,NA,I asked very curious
3151,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins",Herland,sentence,3646,3720,NA,Why you blessed child she said youve got the wrong idea altogether
3152,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins",Herland,sentence,3722,3795,NA,You do not have to think that there ever was such a Godfor there wasnt

3154,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins",Herland,sentence,3836,3897,NA,Nor even that this hideous false idea was believed by anybody
3155,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins",Herland,sentence,3899,4007,NA,But only thisthat people who are utterly ignorant will believe anythingwhich you certainly knew before
3156,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins",Herland,sentence,4010,4088,NA,Anyhow pursued Ellador she turned pale for a minute when I first said it
3157,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins",Herland,sentence,4091,4114,NA,This was a lesson to me
3158,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins",Herland,sentence,4116,4217,NA,No wonder this whole nation of women was peaceful and sweet in expressionthey had no horrible ideas
3159,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins",Herland,sentence,4220,4269,NA,Surely you had some when you began I suggested
3160,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins",Herland,sentence,4272,4290,NA,Oh yes no doubt
3161,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins",Herland,sentence,4292,4374,NA,But as soon as our religion grew to any height at all we left them out of course
3162,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins",Herland,sentence,4377,4456,NA,From this as from many other things I grew to see what I finally put in words
3163,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins",Herland,sentence,4459,4492,NA,Have you no respect for the past
3164,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins",Herland,sentence,4494,4548,NA,For what was thought and believed by your foremothers
3165,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins",Herland,sentence,4551,4570,NA,Why no she said
3166,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins",Herland,sentence,4572,4586,NA,Why should we

3168,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins",Herland,sentence,4607,4632,NA,They knew less than we do
3169,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins",Herland,sentence,4634,4737,NA,If we are not beyond them we are unworthy of themand unworthy of the children who must go beyond us
3170,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins",Herland,sentence,4740,4776,NA,This set me thinking in good earnest
3171,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins",Herland,sentence,4778,4879,NA,I had always imaginedsimply from hearing it said I supposethat women were by nature conservative

3179,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins",Herland,sentence,101,147,NA,Its because we began in a new way I suppose
3180,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins",Herland,sentence,149,263,NA,All our folks were swept away at once and then after that time of despair came those wonder childrenthe first
3181,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins",Herland,sentence,265,354,NA,And then the whole breathless hope of us was for THEIR childrenif they should have them
3182,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins",Herland,sentence,356,368,NA,And they did
3183,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins",Herland,sentence,370,548,NA,Then there was the period of pride and triumph till we grew too numerous and after that when it all came down to one child apiece we began to really workto make better ones
3184,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins",Herland,sentence,551,625,NA,But how does this account for such a radical difference in your religion
3185,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins",Herland,sentence,627,638,NA,I persisted
3186,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins",Herland,sentence,641,786,NA,She said she couldnt talk about the difference very intelligently not being familiar with other religions but that theirs seemed simple enough
3187,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins",Herland,sentence,788,891,NA,Their great Mother Spirit was to them what their own motherhood wasonly magnified beyond human limits
3188,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins",Herland,sentence,893,1077,NA,That meant that they felt beneath and behind them an upholding unfailing serviceable loveperhaps it was really the accumulated motherlove of the race they feltbut it was a Power
3189,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins",Herland,sentence,1080,1117,NA,Just what is your theory of worship
3190,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins",Herland,sentence,1119,1130,NA,I asked her
3191,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins",Herland,sentence,1133,1141,NA,Worship
3192,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins",Herland,sentence,1143,1156,NA,What is that
3193,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins",Herland,sentence,1159,1201,NA,I found it singularly difficult to explain
3194,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins",Herland,sentence,1203,1326,NA,This Divine Love which they felt so strongly did not seem to ask anything of themany more than our mothers do she said
3195,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins",Herland,sentence,1329,1398,NA,But surely your mothers expect honor reverence obedience from you
3196,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins",Herland,sentence,1400,1510,NA,You have to do things for your mothers surely  Oh no she insisted smiling shaking her soft brown hair
3197,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins",Herland,sentence,1512,1556,NA,We do things FROM our mothersnot FOR them

3204,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins",Herland,sentence,1927,1942,NA,Ellador laughed
3205,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins",Herland,sentence,1944,2011,NA,Her eyes were as bright as stars and there were tears in them too
3206,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins",Herland,sentence,2013,2036,NA,She was so sorry for me

3213,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins",Herland,sentence,2322,2498,NA,We have preventive measures and cures sometimes we have to send the patient to bed as it were but thats not a punishmentits only part of the treatment she explained
3214,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins",Herland,sentence,2501,2703,NA,Then studying my point of view more closely she added You see we recognize in our human motherhood a great tender limitless uplifting forcepatience and wisdom and all subtlety of delicate method
3215,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins",Herland,sentence,2705,2759,NA,We credit Godour idea of Godwith all that and more
3216,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins",Herland,sentence,2761,2848,NA,Our mothers are not angry with uswhy should God be  Does God mean a person to you

3223,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins",Herland,sentence,3355,3364,NA,Whiskers
3224,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins",Herland,sentence,3366,3395,NA,Oh yesbecause you have them
3225,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins",Herland,sentence,3397,3519,NA,Or do you wear them because He does  On the contrary we shave them offbecause it seems cleaner and more comfortable
3226,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins",Herland,sentence,3522,3566,NA,Does He wear clothesin your idea I mean
3227,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins",Herland,sentence,3569,3860,NA,I was thinking over the pictures of God I had seenrash advances of the devout mind of man representing his Omnipotent Deity as an old man in a flowing robe flowing hair flowing beard and in the light of her perfectly frank and innocent questions this concept seemed rather unsatisfying
3228,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins",Herland,sentence,3863,4130,NA,I explained that the God of the Christian world was really the ancient Hebrew God and that we had simply taken over the patriarchal ideathat ancient one which quite inevitably clothed its thought of God with the attributes of the patriarchal ruler the grandfather
3229,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins",Herland,sentence,4133,4233,NA,I see she said eagerly after I had explained the genesis and development of our religious ideals
3230,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins",Herland,sentence,4235,4358,NA,They lived in separate groups with a male head and he was probably a littledomineering  No doubt of that I agreed
3231,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins",Herland,sentence,4361,4471,NA,And we live together without any head in that sensejust our chosen leadersthat DOES make a difference
3232,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins",Herland,sentence,4474,4526,NA,Your difference is deeper than that I assured her
3233,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins",Herland,sentence,4528,4560,NA,It is in your common motherhood
3234,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins",Herland,sentence,4562,4621,NA,Your children grow up in a world where everybody loves them
3235,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins",Herland,sentence,4623,4713,NA,They find life made rich and happy for them by the diffused love and wisdom of all mothers
3236,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins",Herland,sentence,4715,4806,NA,So it is easy for you to think of God in the terms of a similar diffused and competent love
3237,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins",Herland,sentence,4808,4853,NA,I think you are far nearer right than we are
3238,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins",Herland,sentence,4856,4965,NA,What I cannot understand she pursued carefully is your preservation of such a very ancient state of mind
3239,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins",Herland,sentence,4967,5001,NA,This patriarchal idea you tell me i
3240,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins",Herland,sentence,1,79,NA,is thousands of years old  Oh yesfour five six thousandevery so many
3241,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins",Herland,sentence,82,152,NA,And you have made wonderful progress in those yearsin other things
3242,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins",Herland,sentence,155,173,NA,We certainly have
3243,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins",Herland,sentence,175,200,NA,But religion is different
3244,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins",Herland,sentence,202,297,NA,You see our religions come from behind us and are initiated by some great teacher who is dead
3245,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins",Herland,sentence,299,366,NA,He is supposed to have known the whole thing and taught it finally
3246,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins",Herland,sentence,368,407,NA,All we have to do is believeand obey
3247,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins",Herland,sentence,410,474,NA,Who was the great Hebrew teacher  Ohthere it was different
3248,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins",Herland,sentence,476,617,NA,The Hebrew religion is an accumulation of extremely ancient traditions some far older than their people and grew by accretion down the ages
3249,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins",Herland,sentence,619,746,NA,We consider it inspiredthe Word of God  How do you know it is  Because it says so  Does it say so in as many words
3250,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins",Herland,sentence,748,766,NA,Who wrote that in
3251,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins",Herland,sentence,769,851,NA,I began to try to recall some text that did say so and could not bring it to mind
3252,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins",Herland,sentence,854,963,NA,Apart from that she pursued what I cannot understand is why you keep these early religious ideas so long
3253,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins",Herland,sentence,965,1042,NA,You have changed all your others havent you  Pretty generally I agreed
3254,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins",Herland,sentence,1044,1104,NA,But this we call revealed religion and think it is final
3255,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins",Herland,sentence,1106,1168,NA,But tell me more about these little temples of yours I urged
3256,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins",Herland,sentence,1170,1207,NA,And these Temple Mothers you run to
3257,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins",Herland,sentence,1210,1303,NA,Then she gave me an extended lesson in applied religion which I will endeavor to concentrate
3258,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins",Herland,sentence,1306,1475,NA,They developed their central theory of a Loving Power and assumed that its relation to them was motherlythat it desired their welfare and especially their development
3259,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins",Herland,sentence,1477,1587,NA,Their relation to it similarly was filial a loving appreciation and a glad fulfillment of its high purposes
3260,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins",Herland,sentence,1589,1712,NA,Then being nothing if not practical they set their keen and active minds to discover the kind of conduct expected of them
3261,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins",Herland,sentence,1714,1766,NA,This worked out in a most admirable system of ethics
3262,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins",Herland,sentence,1768,1826,NA,The principle of Love was universally recognizedand used
3263,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins",Herland,sentence,1829,1928,NA,Patience gentleness courtesy all that we call good breeding was part of their code of conduct
3264,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins",Herland,sentence,1930,2038,NA,But where they went far beyond us was in the special application of religious feeling to every field of life
3265,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins",Herland,sentence,2040,2240,NA,They had no ritual no little set of performances called divine service save those religious pageants I have spoken of and those were as much educational as religious and as much social as either
3266,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins",Herland,sentence,2242,2322,NA,But they had a clear established connection between everything they didand God
3267,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins",Herland,sentence,2324,2529,NA,Their cleanliness their health their exquisite order the rich peaceful beauty of the whole land the happiness of the children and above all the constant progress they madeall this was their religion
3268,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins",Herland,sentence,2532,2658,NA,They applied their minds to the thought of God and worked out the theory that such an inner power demanded outward expression
3269,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins",Herland,sentence,2660,2713,NA,They lived as if God was real and at work within them
3270,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins",Herland,sentence,2716,2854,NA,As for those little temples everywheresome of the women were more skilled more temperamentally inclined in this direction than others
3271,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins",Herland,sentence,2856,3062,NA,These whatever their work might be gave certain hours to the Temple Service which meant being there with all their love and wisdom and trained thought to smooth out rough places for anyone who needed it
3272,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins",Herland,sentence,3064,3199,NA,Sometimes it was a real grief very rarely a quarrel most often a perplexity even in Herland the human soul had its hours of darkness
3273,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins",Herland,sentence,3201,3274,NA,But all through the country their best and wisest were ready to give help
3274,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins",Herland,sentence,3277,3407,NA,If the difficulty was unusually profound the applicant was directed to someone more specially experienced in that line of thought
3275,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins",Herland,sentence,3410,3574,NA,Here was a religion which gave to the searching mind a rational basis in life the concept of an immense Loving Power working steadily out through them toward good
3276,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins",Herland,sentence,3576,3704,NA,It gave to the soul that sense of contact with the inmost force of perception of the uttermost purpose which we always crave
3277,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins",Herland,sentence,3706,3785,NA,It gave to the heart the blessed feeling of being loved loved and UNDERSTOOD
3278,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins",Herland,sentence,3787,3863,NA,It gave clear simple rational directions as to how we should liveand why
3279,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins",Herland,sentence,3865,4151,NA,And for ritual it gave first those triumphant group demonstrations when with a union of all the arts the revivifying combination of great multitudes moved rhythmically with march and dance song and music among their own noblest products and the open beauty of their groves and hills
3280,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins",Herland,sentence,4153,4269,NA,Second it gave these numerous little centers of wisdom where the least wise could go to the most wise and be helped
3281,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins",Herland,sentence,4272,4289,NA,It is beautiful
3282,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins",Herland,sentence,4291,4315,NA,I cried enthusiastically
3283,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins",Herland,sentence,4317,4392,NA,It is the most practical comforting progressive religion I ever heard of
3284,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins",Herland,sentence,4394,4523,NA,You DO love one anotheryou DO bear one anothers burdensyou DO realize that a little child is a type of the kingdom of heaven
3285,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins",Herland,sentence,4525,4574,NA,You are more Christian than any people I ever saw
3286,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins",Herland,sentence,4576,4596,NA,Buthow about death
3287,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins",Herland,sentence,4598,4622,NA,And the life everlasting
3288,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins",Herland,sentence,4624,4669,NA,What does your religion teach about eternity

3321,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins",Herland,sentence,1070,1193,NA,The efforts of inquiring spiritualists always seeking to woo their beloved ghosts back again never seemed to me necessary
3322,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins",Herland,sentence,1195,1321,NA,I dont say I had ever seriously and courageously discussed the subject with myself even I had simply assumed it to be a fact
3323,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins",Herland,sentence,1323,1516,NA,And here was the girl I loved this creature whose character constantly revealed new heights and ranges far beyond my own this superwoman of a superland saying she thought immortality foolish

3418,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins",Herland,sentence,3213,3457,NA,We have a wellfounded theory that it is best to marry in ones class and certain wellgrounded suspicions of international marriages which seem to persist in the interests of social progress rather than in those of the contracting parties
3419,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins",Herland,sentence,3460,3649,NA,But no combination of alien races of color of caste or creed was ever so basically difficult to establish as that between us three modern American men and these three women of Herland

3422,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins",Herland,sentence,3750,3875,NA,We had discussedat least Ellador and I hadthe conditions of The Great Adventure and thought the path was clear before us
3423,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins",Herland,sentence,3877,4042,NA,But there are some things one takes for granted supposes are mutually understood and to which both parties may repeatedly refer without ever meaning the same thing
3424,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins",Herland,sentence,4045,4228,NA,The differences in the education of the average man and woman are great enough but the trouble they make is not mostly for the man he generally carries out his own views of the case

3426,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins",Herland,sentence,4398,4596,NA,I can see clearly and speak calmly about this now writing after a lapse of years years full of growth and education but at the time it was rather hard sledding for all of usespecially for Terry

3428,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins",Herland,sentence,4610,4880,NA,You see in any other imaginable marriage among the peoples of the earth whether the woman were black red yellow brown or white whether she were ignorant or educated submissive or rebellious she would have behind her the marriage tradition of our general history
3429,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins",Herland,sentence,4882,4925,NA,This tradition relates the woman to the man
3430,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins",Herland,sentence,4927,4996,NA,He goes on with his business and she adapts herself to him and to it

3436,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins",Herland,sentence,168,222,NA,Wellhere were we three aliens in this land of women
3437,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins",Herland,sentence,224,309,NA,It was small in area and the external differences were not so great as to astound us
3438,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins",Herland,sentence,311,398,NA,We did not yet appreciate the differences between the racemind of this people and ours
3439,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins",Herland,sentence,401,481,NA,In the first place they were a pure stock of two thousand uninterrupted years
3440,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins",Herland,sentence,483,811,NA,Where we have some long connected lines of thought and feeling together with a wide range of differences often irreconcilable these people were smoothly and firmly agreed on most of the basic principles of their life and not only agreed in principle but accustomed for these sixtyodd generations to act on those principles
3441,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins",Herland,sentence,814,886,NA,This is one thing which we did not understandhad made no allowance for
3442,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins",Herland,sentence,888,1198,NA,When in our premarital discussions one of those dear girls had said We understand it thus and thus or We hold such and such to be true we men in our own deepseated convictions of the power of love and our easy views about beliefs and principles fondly imagined that we could convince them otherwise
3443,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins",Herland,sentence,1200,1308,NA,What we imagined before marriage did not matter any more than what an average innocent young girl imagines
3444,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins",Herland,sentence,1310,1344,NA,We found the facts to be different
3445,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins",Herland,sentence,1347,1412,NA,It was not that they did not love us they did deeply and warmly
3446,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins",Herland,sentence,1414,1510,NA,But there are you againwhat they meant by love and what we meant by love were so different
3447,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins",Herland,sentence,1513,1702,NA,Perhaps it seems rather coldblooded to say we and they as if we were not separate couples with our separate joys and sorrows but our positions as aliens drove us together constantly
3448,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins",Herland,sentence,1704,1860,NA,The whole strange experience had made our friendship more close and intimate than it would ever have become in a free and easy lifetime among our own people
3449,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins",Herland,sentence,1862,2024,NA,Also as men with our masculine tradition of far more than two thousand years we were a unit small but firm against this far larger unit of feminine tradition
3450,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins",Herland,sentence,2027,2111,NA,I think I can make clear the points of difference without a too painful explicitness
3451,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins",Herland,sentence,2113,2301,NA,The more external disagreement was in the matter of the home and the housekeeping duties and pleasures we by instinct and long education supposed to be inherently appropriate to women
3452,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins",Herland,sentence,2304,2431,NA,I will give two illustrations one away up and the other away down to show how completely disappointed we were in this regard

3454,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins",Herland,sentence,2628,2788,NA,This female ant might regard him with intense personal affection but her ideas of parentage and economic management would be on a very different scale from his
3455,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins",Herland,sentence,2790,2940,NA,Now of course if she was a stray female in a country of pairing ants he might have had his way with her but if he was a stray male in an anthill
3456,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins",Herland,sentence,2943,3163,NA,For the higher one try to imagine a devoted and impassioned man trying to set up housekeeping with a lady angel a real wingsandharpandhalo angel accustomed to fulfilling divine missions all over interstellar space
3457,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins",Herland,sentence,3165,3348,NA,This angel might love the man with an affection quite beyond his power of return or even of appreciation but her ideas of service and duty would be on a very different scale from his
3458,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins",Herland,sentence,3350,3483,NA,Of course if she was a stray angel in a country of men he might have had his way with her but if he was a stray man among angels

3465,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins",Herland,sentence,3911,4170,NA,He so worshipped Celis and not only Celis but what she represented he had become so deeply convinced of the almost supernatural advantages of this country and people that he took his medicine like aI cannot say like a man but more as if he wasnt one

3469,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins",Herland,sentence,4356,4401,NA,But there was always this angel streak in him
3470,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins",Herland,sentence,4403,4568,NA,It was rather a wonder Terry being so different that he really loved Jeff as he did but it happens so sometimes in spite of the differenceperhaps because of it
3471,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins",Herland,sentence,4571,4597,NA,As for me I stood between
3472,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins",Herland,sentence,4599,4663,NA,I was no such gay Lothario as Terry and no such Galahad as Jeff
3473,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins",Herland,sentence,4665,4799,NA,But for all my limitations I think I had the habit of using my brains in regard to behavior rather more frequently than either of them
3474,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins",Herland,sentence,4801,4845,NA,I had to use brainpower now I can tell you
3475,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins",Herland,sentence,4848,4962,NA,The big point at issue between us and our wives was as may easily be imagined in the very nature of the relation

3488,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins",Herland,sentence,357,368,NA,FATHERHOOD
3489,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins",Herland,sentence,370,416,NA,As if a man was always wanting to be a FATHER

3491,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins",Herland,sentence,442,590,NA,They had their long wide deep rich experience of Motherhood and their only perception of the value of a male creature as such was for Fatherhood
3492,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins",Herland,sentence,593,726,NA,Aside from that of course was the whole range of personal love love which as Jeff earnestly phrased it passeth the love of women
3493,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins",Herland,sentence,728,739,NA,It did too
3494,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins",Herland,sentence,741,915,NA,I can give no ideaeither now after long and happy experience of it or as it seemed then in the first measureless wonderof the beauty and power of the love they gave us

3502,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins",Herland,sentence,1814,1991,NA,From earliest childhood each had a separate bedroom with toilet conveniences and one of the marks of coming of age was the addition of an outer room in which to receive friends

3507,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins",Herland,sentence,2434,2608,NA,After marriage there arose in us a somewhat unexpected urge of feeling that called for a separate house but this feeling found no response in the hearts of those fair ladies

3580,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins",Herland,sentence,3303,3521,NA,And no child stormily demanding a cookie between meals was ever more subtly diverted into an interest in housebuilding than was I when I found an apparently imperative demand had disappeared without my noticing it

3615,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins",Herland,sentence,1385,1864,NA,It was as if I had come to some new place and people with a desire to eat at all hours and no other interests in particular and as if my hosts instead of merely saying You shall not eat had presently aroused in me a lively desire for music for pictures for games for exercise for playing in the water for running some ingenious machine and in the multitude of my satisfactions I forgot the one point which was not satisfied and got along very well until mealtime
3616,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins",Herland,sentence,1867,2053,NA,One of the cleverest and most ingenious of these tricks was only clear to me many years after when we were so wholly at one on this subject that I could laugh at my own predicament then
3617,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins",Herland,sentence,2055,2153,NA,It was this You see with us women are kept as different as possible and as feminine as possible
3618,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins",Herland,sentence,2155,2277,NA,We men have our own world with only men in it we get tired of our ultramaleness and turn gladly to the ultrafemaleness
3619,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins",Herland,sentence,2279,2414,NA,Also in keeping our women as feminine as possible we see to it that when we turn to them we find the thing we want always in evidence

3621,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins",Herland,sentence,2479,2575,NA,The very numbers of these human women always in human relation made them anything but alluring
3622,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins",Herland,sentence,2577,2816,NA,When in spite of this my hereditary instincts and racetraditions made me long for the feminine response in Ellador instead of withdrawing so that I should want her more she deliberately gave me a little too much of her societyalways
3623,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins",Herland,sentence,2818,2842,NA,defeminized as it were
3624,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins",Herland,sentence,2844,2872,NA,It was awfully funny really
3625,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins",Herland,sentence,2875,3102,NA,Here was I with an Ideal in mind for which I hotly longed and here was she deliberately obtruding in the foreground of my consciousness a Facta fact which I coolly enjoyed but which actually interfered with what I wanted
3626,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins",Herland,sentence,3104,3226,NA,I see now clearly enough why a certain kind of man like Sir Almroth Wright resents the professional development of women
3627,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins",Herland,sentence,3228,3310,NA,It gets in the way of the sex ideal it temporarily covers and excludes femininity
3628,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins",Herland,sentence,3313,3463,NA,Of course in this case I was so fond of Ellador my friend of Ellador my professional companion that I necessarily enjoyed her society on any terms

3633,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins",Herland,sentence,3788,3985,NA,But this I soon began to find that under all our cultivated attitude of mind toward women there is an older deeper more natural feeling the restful reverence which looks up to the Mother sex
3634,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins",Herland,sentence,3988,4077,NA,So we grew together in friendship and happiness Ellador and I and so did Jeff and Celis
3635,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins",Herland,sentence,4080,4156,NA,When it comes to Terrys part of it and Alimas Im sorryand Im ashamed

3637,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins",Herland,sentence,4190,4367,NA,She wasnt as fine a psychologist as Ellador and whats more I think she had a fardescended atavistic trace of more marked femaleness never apparent till Terry called it out

3673,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins",Herland,sentence,1470,1629,NA,I think that owing to all those differences I spoke of they soon lost the common ground they had at first and were unable to meet sanely and dispassionately
3674,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins",Herland,sentence,1631,1849,NA,I fancy toothis is pure conjecturethat he had succeeded in driving Alima beyond her best judgment her real conscience and that after that her own sense of shame the reaction of the thing made her bitter perhaps

3743,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins",Herland,sentence,2554,2687,NA,Look here my dear I said to her If you are really going to my country with me youve got to be prepared for a good many shocks
3744,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins",Herland,sentence,2689,2853,NA,Its not as beautiful as thisthe cities I mean the civilized partsof course the wild country is  I shall enjoy it all she said her eyes starry with hope
3745,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins",Herland,sentence,2855,2887,NA,I understand its not like ours
3746,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins",Herland,sentence,2889,2983,NA,I can see how monotonous our quiet life must seem to you how much more stirring yours must be
3747,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins",Herland,sentence,2985,3151,NA,It must be like the biological change you told me about when the second sex was introduceda far greater movement constant change with new possibilities of growth
3748,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins",Herland,sentence,3154,3322,NA,I had told her of the later biological theories of sex and she was deeply convinced of the superior advantages of having two the superiority of a world with men in it
3749,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins",Herland,sentence,3325,3551,NA,We have done what we could alone perhaps we have some things better in a quiet way but you have the whole worldall the people of the different nationsall the long rich history behind youall the wonderful new knowledge

3751,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins",Herland,sentence,3588,3603,NA,What could I do
3752,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins",Herland,sentence,3605,3891,NA,I told her in so many words that we had our unsolved problems that we had dishonesty and corruption vice and crime disease and insanity prisons and hospitals and it made no more impression on her than it would to tell a South Sea Islander about the temperature of the Arctic Circle
3753,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins",Herland,sentence,3893,3985,NA,She could intellectually see that it was bad to have those things but she could not FEEL it
3754,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins",Herland,sentence,3988,4146,NA,We had quite easily come to accept the Herland life as normal because it was normalnone of us make any outcry over mere health and peace and happy industry
3755,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins",Herland,sentence,4148,4230,NA,And the abnormal to which we are all so sadly well acclimated she had never seen
3756,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins",Herland,sentence,4233,4475,NA,The two things she cared most to hear about and wanted most to see were these the beautiful relation of marriage and the lovely women who were mothers and nothing else beyond these her keen active mind hungered eagerly for the world life
3757,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins",Herland,sentence,4478,4581,NA,Im almost as anxious to go as you are yourself she insisted and you must be desperately homesick
3758,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins",Herland,sentence,4584,4687,NA,I assured her that no one could be homesick in such a paradise as theirs but she would have none of it
3759,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins",Herland,sentence,4690,4706,NA,Oh yesI know
3760,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins",Herland,sentence,4708,4838,NA,Its like those little tropical islands youve told me about shining like jewels in the big blue seaI cant wait to see the sea

3771,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins",Herland,sentence,1,20,NA,s more than willing
3772,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins",Herland,sentence,22,228,NA,But the nearer it came to our really going and to my having to take her back to our civilization after the clean peace and beauty of theirs the more I began to dread it and the more I tried to explain
3773,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins",Herland,sentence,231,316,NA,Of course I had been homesick at first while we were prisoners before I had Ellador
3774,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins",Herland,sentence,318,407,NA,And of course I had at first rather idealized my country and its ways in describing it
3775,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins",Herland,sentence,409,519,NA,Also I had always accepted certain evils as integral parts of our civilization and never dwelt on them at all
3776,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins",Herland,sentence,521,681,NA,Even when I tried to tell her the worst I never remembered some thingswhich when she came to see them impressed her at once as they had never impressed me
3777,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins",Herland,sentence,683,844,NA,Now in my efforts at explanation I began to see both ways more keenly than I had before to see the painful defects of my own land the marvelous gains of this
3778,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins",Herland,sentence,847,982,NA,In missing men we three visitors had naturally missed the larger part of life and had unconsciously assumed that they must miss it too
3779,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins",Herland,sentence,984,1071,NA,It took me a long time to realizeTerry never did realizehow little it meant to them
3780,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins",Herland,sentence,1073,1255,NA,When we say MEN MAN MANLY MANHOOD and all the other masculine derivatives we have in the background of our minds a huge vague crowded picture of the world and all its activities
3781,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins",Herland,sentence,1257,1347,NA,To grow up and be a man to act like a manthe meaning and connotation is wide indeed
3782,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins",Herland,sentence,1349,1838,NA,That vast background is full of marching columns of men of changing lines of men of long processions of men of men steering their ships into new seas exploring unknown mountains breaking horses herding cattle ploughing and sowing and reaping toiling at the forge and furnace digging in the mine building roads and bridges and high cathedrals managing great businesses teaching in all the colleges preaching in all the churches of men everywhere doing everythingthe world
3783,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins",Herland,sentence,1841,1888,NA,And when we say WOMEN we think FEMALEthe sex
3784,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins",Herland,sentence,1891,2132,NA,But to these women in the unbroken sweep of this twothousandyearold feminine civilization the word WOMAN called up all that big background so far as they had gone in social development and the word MAN meant to them only MALEthe sex
3785,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins",Herland,sentence,2135,2254,NA,Of course we could TELL them that in our world men did everything but that did not alter the background of their minds
3786,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins",Herland,sentence,2256,2475,NA,That man the male did all these things was to them a statement making no more change in the point of view than was made in ours when we first faced the astounding factto usthat in Herland women were the world
3787,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins",Herland,sentence,2478,2519,NA,We had been living there more than a year
3788,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins",Herland,sentence,2521,2683,NA,We had learned their limited history with its straight smooth upreaching lines reaching higher and going faster up to the smooth comfort of their present life
3789,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins",Herland,sentence,2685,2806,NA,We had learned a little of their psychology a much wider field than the history but here we could not follow so readily
3790,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins",Herland,sentence,2808,2921,NA,We were now well used to seeing women not as females but as people people of all sorts doing every kind of work
3791,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins",Herland,sentence,2924,3033,NA,This outbreak of Terrys and the strong reaction against it gave us a new light on their genuine femininity
3792,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins",Herland,sentence,3035,3099,NA,This was given me with great clearness by both Ellador and Somel
3793,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins",Herland,sentence,3101,3203,NA,The feeling was the samesick revulsion and horror such as would be felt at some climactic blasphemy
3794,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins",Herland,sentence,3206,3328,NA,They had no faintest approach to such a thing in their minds knowing nothing of the custom of marital indulgence among us
3795,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins",Herland,sentence,3330,3711,NA,To them the one high purpose of motherhood had been for so long the governing law of life and the contribution of the father though known to them so distinctly another method to the same end that they could not with all their effort get the point of view of the male creature whose desires quite ignore parentage and seek only for what we euphoniously term the joys of love
3796,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins",Herland,sentence,3714,3878,NA,When I tried to tell Ellador that women too felt so with us she drew away from me and tried hard to grasp intellectually what she could in no way sympathize with
3797,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins",Herland,sentence,3881,3992,NA,You meanthat with youlove between man and woman expresses itself in that waywithout regard to motherhood
3798,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins",Herland,sentence,3994,4036,NA,To parentage I mean she added carefully
3799,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins",Herland,sentence,4039,4051,NA,Yes surely
3800,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins",Herland,sentence,4053,4108,NA,It is love we think ofthe deep sweet love between two
3801,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins",Herland,sentence,4110,4193,NA,Of course we want children and children comebut that is not what we think about
3802,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins",Herland,sentence,4196,4244,NA,Butbutit seems so against nature she said
3803,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins",Herland,sentence,4246,4284,NA,None of the creatures we know do that
3804,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins",Herland,sentence,4286,4343,NA,Do other animalsin your country  We are not animals
3805,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins",Herland,sentence,4345,4374,NA,I replied with some sharpness
3806,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins",Herland,sentence,4376,4425,NA,At least we are something moresomething higher
3807,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins",Herland,sentence,4427,4503,NA,This is a far nobler and more beautiful relation as I have explained before
3808,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins",Herland,sentence,4505,4557,NA,Your view seems to us rathershall I say practical
3809,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins",Herland,sentence,4559,4566,NA,Prosaic
3810,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins",Herland,sentence,4568,4592,NA,Merely a means to an end
3811,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins",Herland,sentence,4594,4652,NA,With usoh my dear girlcannot you see Cannot you feel
3812,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins",Herland,sentence,4654,4716,NA,It is the last sweetest highest consummation of mutual love
3813,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins",Herland,sentence,4719,4744,NA,She was impressed visibly
3814,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins",Herland,sentence,4746,4812,NA,She trembled in my arms as I held her close kissing her hungrily
3815,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins",Herland,sentence,4814,5001,NA,But there rose in her eyes that look I knew so well that remote clear look as if she had gone far away even though I held her beautiful body so close and was now on some snowy mountain r
3816,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins",Herland,sentence,1,29,NA,regarding me from a distance
3817,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins",Herland,sentence,32,73,NA,I feel it quite clearly she said to me
3818,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins",Herland,sentence,75,152,NA,It gives me a deep sympathy with what you feel no doubt more strongly still
3819,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins",Herland,sentence,154,237,NA,But what I feel even what you feel dearest does not convince me that it is right
3820,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins",Herland,sentence,239,298,NA,Until I am sure of that of course I cannot do as you wish
3821,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins",Herland,sentence,301,361,NA,Ellador at times like this always reminded me of Epictetus
3822,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins",Herland,sentence,363,406,NA,I will put you in prison said his master
3823,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins",Herland,sentence,408,453,NA,My body you mean replied Epictetus calmly
3824,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins",Herland,sentence,455,498,NA,I will cut your head off said his master
3825,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins",Herland,sentence,500,547,NA,Have I said that my head could not be cut off
3826,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins",Herland,sentence,549,578,NA,A difficult person Epictetus
3827,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins",Herland,sentence,581,739,NA,What is this miracle by which a woman even in your arms may withdraw herself utterly disappear till what you hold is as inaccessible as the face of a cliff
3828,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins",Herland,sentence,742,787,NA,Be patient with me dear she urged sweetly
3829,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins",Herland,sentence,789,815,NA,I know it is hard for you
3830,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins",Herland,sentence,817,880,NA,And I begin to seea littlehow Terry was so driven to crime
3831,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins",Herland,sentence,883,926,NA,Oh come thats a pretty hard word for it
3832,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins",Herland,sentence,928,1042,NA,After all Alima was his wife you know I urged feeling at the moment a sudden burst of sympathy for poor Terry
3833,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins",Herland,sentence,1044,1127,NA,For a man of his temperamentand habitsit must have been an unbearable situation
3834,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins",Herland,sentence,1130,1306,NA,But Ellador for all her wide intellectual grasp and the broad sympathy in which their religion trained them could not make allowance for suchto hersacrilegious brutality
3835,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins",Herland,sentence,1309,1628,NA,It was the more difficult to explain to her because we three in our constant talks and lectures about the rest of the world had naturally avoided the seamy side not so much from a desire to deceive but from wishing to put the best foot foremost for our civilization in the face of the beauty and comfort of theirs
3836,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins",Herland,sentence,1630,1787,NA,Also we really thought some things were right or at least unavoidable which we could readily see would be repugnant to them and therefore did not discuss
3837,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins",Herland,sentence,1789,1902,NA,Again there was much of our worlds life which we being used to it had not noticed as anything worth describing
3838,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins",Herland,sentence,1904,2044,NA,And still further there was about these women a colossal innocence upon which many of the things we did say had made no impression whatever
3839,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins",Herland,sentence,2047,2194,NA,I am thus explicit about it because it shows how unexpectedly strong was the impression made upon Ellador when she at last entered our civilization
3840,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins",Herland,sentence,2197,2242,NA,She urged me to be patient and I was patient
3841,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins",Herland,sentence,2244,2348,NA,You see I loved her so much that even the restrictions she so firmly established left me much happiness
3842,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins",Herland,sentence,2350,2408,NA,We were lovers and there is surely delight enough in that
3843,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins",Herland,sentence,2411,2528,NA,Do not imagine that these young women utterly refused the Great New Hope as they called it that of dual parentage
3844,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins",Herland,sentence,2530,2652,NA,For that they had agreed to marry us though the marrying part of it was a concession to our prejudices rather than theirs
3845,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins",Herland,sentence,2654,2724,NA,To them the process was the holy thingand they meant to keep it holy
3846,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins",Herland,sentence,2727,2944,NA,But so far only Celis her blue eyes swimming in happy tears her heart lifted with that tide of racemotherhood which was their supreme passion could with ineffable joy and pride announce that she was to be a mother
3847,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins",Herland,sentence,2946,3009,NA,The New Motherhood they called it and the whole country knew
3848,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins",Herland,sentence,3011,3100,NA,There was no pleasure no service no honor in all the land that Celis might not have had
3849,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins",Herland,sentence,3102,3331,NA,Almost like the breathless reverence with which two thousand years ago that dwindling band of women had watched the miracle of virgin birth was the deep awe and warm expectancy with which they greeted this new miracle of union
3850,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins",Herland,sentence,3334,3368,NA,All mothers in that land were holy
3851,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins",Herland,sentence,3370,3541,NA,To them for long ages the approach to motherhood has been by the most intense and exquisite love and longing by the Supreme Desire the overmastering demand for a child
3852,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins",Herland,sentence,3543,3651,NA,Every thought they held in connection with the processes of maternity was open to the day simple yet sacred
3853,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins",Herland,sentence,3653,3797,NA,Every woman of them placed motherhood not only higher than other duties but so far higher that there were no other duties one might almost say
3854,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins",Herland,sentence,3799,4129,NA,All their wide mutual love all the subtle interplay of mutual friendship and service the urge of progressive thought and invention the deepest religious emotion every feeling and every act was related to this great central Power to the River of Life pouring through them which made them the bearers of the very Spirit of God
3855,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins",Herland,sentence,4132,4221,NA,Of all this I learned more and morefrom their books from talk especially from Ellador
3856,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins",Herland,sentence,4223,4335,NA,She was at first for a brief moment envious of her frienda thought she put away from her at once and forever
3857,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins",Herland,sentence,4338,4368,NA,It is better she said to me
3858,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins",Herland,sentence,4370,4435,NA,It is much better that it has not come to me yetto us that is
3859,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins",Herland,sentence,4437,4602,NA,For if I am to go with you to your country we may have adventures by sea and land as you say and as in truth we did and it might not be at all safe for a baby
3860,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins",Herland,sentence,4604,4658,NA,So we wont try again dear till it is safewill we
3861,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins",Herland,sentence,4661,4709,NA,This was a hard saying for a very loving husband
3862,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins",Herland,sentence,4712,4778,NA,Unless she went on if one is coming you will leave me behind
3863,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins",Herland,sentence,4780,4836,NA,You can come back you knowand I shall have the child
3864,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins",Herland,sentence,4839,4925,NA,Then that deep ancient chill of male jealousy of even his own progeny touched my heart
3865,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins",Herland,sentence,4928,4993,NA,Id rather have you Ellador than all the children in the world
3866,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins",Herland,sentence,4995,5001,NA,Id rat

3869,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins",Herland,sentence,67,96,NA,This was a very stupid saying
3870,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins",Herland,sentence,98,115,NA,Of course I would
3871,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins",Herland,sentence,117,186,NA,For if she wasnt there I should want all of her and have none of her
3872,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins",Herland,sentence,188,336,NA,But if she went along as a sort of sublimated sisteronly much closer and warmer than that reallywhy I should have all of her but that one thing
3873,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins",Herland,sentence,338,587,NA,And I was beginning to find that Elladors friendship Elladors comradeship Elladors sisterly affection Elladors perfectly sincere lovenone the less deep that she held it back on a definite line of reservewere enough to live on very happily
3874,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins",Herland,sentence,590,653,NA,I find it quite beyond me to describe what this woman was to me
3875,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins",Herland,sentence,655,761,NA,We talk fine things about women but in our hearts we know that they are very limited beingsmost of them
3876,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins",Herland,sentence,763,1284,NA,We honor them for their functional powers even while we dishonor them by our use of it we honor them for their carefully enforced virtue even while we show by our own conduct how little we think of that virtue we value them sincerely for the perverted maternal activities which make our wives the most comfortable of servants bound to us for life with the wages wholly at our own decision their whole business outside of the temporary duties of such motherhood as they may achieve to meet our needs in every way
3877,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins",Herland,sentence,1286,1518,NA,Oh we value them all right in their place which place is the home where they perform that mixture of duties so ably described by Mrs Josephine Dodge Daskam Bacon in which the services of a mistress are carefully specified
3878,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins",Herland,sentence,1520,1624,NA,She is a very clear writer Mrs J D D Bacon and understands her subjectfrom her own point of view
3879,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins",Herland,sentence,1626,1775,NA,Butthat combination of industries while convenient and in a way economical does not arouse the kind of emotion commanded by the women of Herland
3880,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins",Herland,sentence,1777,1845,NA,These were women one had to love up very high up instead of down
3881,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins",Herland,sentence,1847,1865,NA,They were not pets
3882,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins",Herland,sentence,1867,1889,NA,They were not servants
3883,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins",Herland,sentence,1891,1931,NA,They were not timid inexperienced weak
3884,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins",Herland,sentence,1934,2190,NA,After I got over the jar to my pride which Jeff I truly think never felthe was a born worshipper and which Terry never got overhe was quite clear in his ideas of the position of women I found that loving up was a very good sensation after all
3885,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins",Herland,sentence,2192,2370,NA,It gave me a queer feeling way down deep as of the stirring of some ancient dim prehistoric consciousness a feeling that they were right somehowthat this was the way to feel
3886,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins",Herland,sentence,2372,2406,NA,It was likecoming home to mother
3887,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins",Herland,sentence,2408,2538,NA,I dont mean the underflannelsanddoughnuts mother the fussy person that waits on you and spoils you and doesnt really know you
3888,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins",Herland,sentence,2540,2631,NA,I mean the feeling that a very little child would have who had been lostfor ever so long
3889,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins",Herland,sentence,2633,2861,NA,It was a sense of getting home of being clean and rested of safety and yet freedom of love that was always there warm like sunshine in May not hot like a stove or a featherbeda love that didnt irritate and didnt smother
3890,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins",Herland,sentence,2864,2914,NA,I looked at Ellador as if I hadnt seen her before
3891,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins",Herland,sentence,2916,2991,NA,If you wont go I said Ill get Terry to the coast and come back alone
3892,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins",Herland,sentence,2993,3019,NA,You can let me down a rope
3893,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins",Herland,sentence,3021,3208,NA,And if you will gowhy you blessed wonderwomanI would rather live with you all my lifelike thisthan to have any other woman I ever saw or any number of them to do as I like with

3895,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins",Herland,sentence,3227,3250,NA,She was keen for coming
3896,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins",Herland,sentence,3252,3272,NA,So the plans went on
3897,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins",Herland,sentence,3274,3355,NA,Shed have liked to wait for that Marvel of Celiss but Terry had no such desire
3898,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins",Herland,sentence,3357,3389,NA,He was crazy to be out of it all

3900,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins",Herland,sentence,3466,3574,NA,I dont think Terry had what the phrenologists call the lump of philoprogenitiveness at all well developed
3901,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins",Herland,sentence,3577,3857,NA,Morbid onesided cripples he called them even when from his window he could see their splendid vigor and beauty even while Moadine as patient and friendly as if she had never helped Alima to hold and bind him sat there in the room the picture of wisdom and serene strength
3902,"Gilman, Charlotte Perkins",Herland,sentence,3859,3919,NA,Sexless epicene undeveloped neuters he went on bitterly
